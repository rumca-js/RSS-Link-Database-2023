Sony has <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2023/new-management-structure-of-sony-interactive-entertainment-2/">announced</a> PlayStation boss Jim Ryan will be retiring next March, after nearly 30 years with the company, having joined in 1994.
</p><p>
Ryan - whose official job title is president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment - took charge of the PlayStation division back in February 2019, having previously headed up Sony Computer Interactive Europe.
</p><p>
In a statement announcing his retirement, Ryan wrote, "I've relished the opportunity to have a job I love in a very special company, working with great people and incredible partners. But I've found it increasingly difficult to reconcile living in Europe and working in North America.

We already knew Meta Quest 3 was on the way after Meta <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meta-quest-3-is-official-499-and-arriving-this-autumn">made its latest consumer VR headset official</a> back in June - just ahead of Apple's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-unveils-3499-augmented-reality-vision-pro-headset">Vision Pro reveal</a> - but the company has now slapped it with a launch date, announcing it'll arrive on 10th October, with pre-orders open now.
</p><p>
April's initial reveal confirmed some top-level features for Meta's new VR headset - which is now more accurately described as a mixed reality headset - but we now have a much clearer ideas of the specs being packed into this third Quest iteration.

Meta Quest 3 is powered by the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor - which Meta says can manage "dou

How do you follow up a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-a-dizzying-game-of-many-parts-and-a-journey-into-deep-wonder">five-star treat</a> like Dave the Diver? With a zombie-themed, 16-player PvPvE stealth-survival extraction game, of course! Developer Mintrocket has just unveiled its next project, titled Nakwon: Last Paradise, and it's about as much a departure from its acclaimed snorkelling-and-sushi-restaurant-management adventure as you can get, dropping players onto the streets of Seoul, right into the middle of the undead apocalypse.
</p><p>
As per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2582960/view/3710460111412984692">Mintrocket's lengthy Steam announcement</a>, Nakwon's action is split into two main parts; on the Scouting side, players - with a friend in tow if desired - must lea

Netflix's promisingly outlandish Far Cry animated adaptation is almost upon us, with the series - titled Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix - set to hit the streaming service on 19th October. And ahead of its arrival, Netflix has shared a fresh trailer showcasing its chaotic action, this one welcoming Rayman and a bunch of other familiar Ubisoft faces.
</p><p>
Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix takes its cue from Ubisoft's gleefully ludicrous, 80s-inspired Far Cry 3 expansion, Blood Dragon. It's set in an alternate version of Earth's 1992 where a massive tech company, Eden, exerts social control via mass surveillance and big data.
</p><p>
Enter series protagonist Dolph Laserhawk, a cybernetically enhanced super soldier who escapes from the Eden army and decides to embark on one final heist before s

Roughly two years after Netflix announced plans for a Tomb Raider anime, we've finally been given our first look at Lara Croft in cartoon action. 
</p><p>
The Tomb Raider animation is set to focus on the events following the reboot trilogy's conclusion. Lara has returned from her travels in South America, having prevented an apocalypse of some description, and is now ready for her next adventure. 
</p><p>
Netflix's debut trailer is quite brief, featuring a lot of heavy breathing from our heroine over the top of a handful of impactful shots. We get to see Lara abseiling into a cavernous abyss and - perhaps in homage to one of Shadow of the Tomb Raider's better moments - emerging onto the scene while a backdrop of flames silhouettes her (presumably) rather battle weary figure. There is also a nice little nod to the Yamatai crew from th

Cast your mind back to 2018, and you might recall Adi Shankar - the producer of Netflix's acclaimed Castlevania adaptation - announcing he also had a Devil May Cry animated series in the works. Five years on, and the streaming service has now given us a first look at the show, which is supposedly coming "soon".
</p><p>
Netflix's animated Devil May Cry series has been made in collaboration with Capcom, and comes from Studio Mir - the animation team behind the likes of The Legend of Korra and My Adventures with Superman.
</p><p>
Beyond that, details are almost entirely non-existent at present, although Netflix's announcement trailer does at least gives us a quick look at the adaptation's interpretation of Dante, who looks to be well and truly in "cocky pretty boy" mode for this outing.

Following reports earlier this year that Far Cry 7 is currently in the works at Ubisoft, story and gameplay details have emerged claiming the game will see players attempting to rescue their wealthy family, who've been kidnapped by a group calling itself the Sons of Truth.
</p><p>
That's <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-7-story-details/">according to Insider Gaming</a>, who first reported news of Far Cry 7's development - later corroborated by Kotaku - back in January. Citing undisclosed "sources", the website says Far Cry 7, codenamed Project Blackbird, will feature a "non-linear" story based around the kidnapping of the protagonist's family, that plays out over - and seemingly must be completed within - 72 in-game hours, equating to 24 hours in real-time.

After all, Forza 2023 has been in development longer than any prior entry in the Motorsport series and expectations are high.

The company has shared an open letter to Sony on social media and its website, apologising to customers for the situation and stating this was "PlayStation's decision, not ours".
</p><p>
The items it claims to have been told to destroy include in-stock items, items ready to be shipped, items in production, and items in development. These are from a range of franchises, including The Last of Us, God of War, Bloodborne, and Ratchet &amp; Clank.

## Hands-on with Alan Wake 2's two protagonists and their very different realities

It's been 13 years since Alan and his typewriter first made their way onto Xbox 360, in a twisted and often perplexing story that ultimately left the author in the Dark Place, a surreal alternate dimension where works of art shape reality. Now, ahead of Alan Wake 2's long-awaited October release, I've gone hands-on to find out how our favourite fictional writer is holding up. 
</p><p>
At a very basic level, much of Alan Wake 2's gameplay will feel familiar to those who have played the original. Players have access to firearms, torches are used to burn away shadows, Alan can dodge attacks and also heroically sprint away when a little more distance is needed (something I did quite often). Outside of combat, there are plenty of shadowy environments to explore, and light will once again be key to overcoming many obstacles i

## Sam Lake and Remedy on Alan Wake 2's move to survival horror and pushing the franchise's boundaries

It's been 13 years since Alan Wake launched himself into the murky waters of Cauldron Lake in a bid to save his wife, Alice. For over a decade, he has been left languishing in the Dark Place, with surreal visions and a nightmarish hell dimension his only company. But now he is back in Alan Wake 2, Remedy's much anticipated sequel, and ready to burn the darkness away once again. 
</p><p>
This time, however, Remedy has decided to take the series in a new direction. The developer is shaking off the action-adventure genre that came before, and is instead treading a new path - that of survival horror. But how and why did Remedy make this jump between genres? And, why now?
</p><p>
"Coming out of Max Payne way back when, we didn't really explore the idea of different game genres," creative director Sam Lake told me at an Alan W

On PlayStation 5, the Complete Edition will launch on 6th October priced $60 / &euro;60 / &yen;7,980. I am assuming this will convert to roughly &pound;55 here in the UK, but have emailed Sony to ask for clarification.

The Complete Edition will then be available for PC players via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2420110/Horizon_Forbidden_West_Complete_Edition/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horizon-forbidden-west-complete-edition">Epic Game Store</a> sometime in early 2024.

Ubisoft chief Yves Guillemot believes cloud streaming will be as transformative to gaming in the coming years as Netflix was to TV. 
</p><p>
Speaking with the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/71858db3-b1b1-4b53-b25b-3f2402a2fbf9">Financial Times</a>, Guillemot looked back on Netflix's initial foray into streaming and noted the market's early scepticism. "Their shares fell a lot and they were widely criticised," he recalled. "Today, we see what they have become."
</p><p>
Guillemot said he believes the same will eventually ring true for video game streaming as well, but admitted it will likely take some time. "But when it takes off, it will happen very quickly," he said.

Mortal Kombat 1 players have discovered a bug that gives player one a distinct advantage.

Certain combos executed by player one cannot be replicated by player two, a problem that persists across all playable characters and even in online multiplayer modes.

YouTuber mrAPchem uploaded a video that demonstrates the issue (thanks <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mortal-kombat-1-player-1-advantage-problem/">TheGamer</a>), setting up a Mirror Match with Sub-Zero and attempting the same combo as both player one and player two.

If you were looking to get your hands on FIFA games from years past, you will have to look for a second hand physical copy, as EA has delisted its FIFA back catalogue from digital storefronts.
</p><p>
The games' removal was first noticed by X (formerly Twitter) user <a href="https://twitter.com/MauroNL3/status/1706728860405186570">MauroNL3</a>, who noted "every FIFA title from 14 up to 23 can't be purchased anymore".
</p><p>
I went and had a quick look for myself, and can verify this to be true.

Exploring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-guides-tips-tricks-9352">Starfield</a>'s planets was previously a lot harder, Bethesda has revealed, before the developer decided to dial back some "very punitive" atmosphere effects.
</p><p>
The Bethesda space RPG's many planets still feature environmental hazards, such as extreme temperatures and radiation. But the impact these have on your character is now fairly minimal - whereas previously this system would have seen players having to swap spacesuits to meet local conditions.
</p><p>
Bethesda boss Todd Howard revealed the change during an episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNQzIjptC_o">Game Maker's Notebook</a> podcast, which is well worth a watch. In it, Howard discusses the challenges of creating inte

In 1993, EA Sports released FIFA International Soccer, on the Sega Mega Drive. The matches unfolded on a fuzz of green pixels, as though the players were bounding over squares of baize. The teams were all national, no clubs, and the licence did not yet extend to names, kits, or stadiums. But, despite the game nearly being branded "Team USA Soccer" in North America, the name stuck. Just. In an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140911211000/http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/rejection-tragedy-and-billions-of-dollars-the-story-of-fifa/0120299">interview with MCV</a> in 2014, Neil Thewarapperuma, the head of marketing at EA Sports in the nineties, put it delicately: "EA didn't give a shit about FIFA." Thirty years on, with the release of EA Sports FC 24, the developer has parted ways with the organisation that lent the series
