## Blue Beetle Ending And Mid-Credits Scene Explained

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blue-beetle-review-spared-lots-of-expense/1900-6418104/">Blue Beetle</a> is being billed as the first movie of the newly rebooted DC movieverse, but it's not overly concerned about that. This is a small-scale story--a 22-year old kid gets superpowers from an alien relic, and the greedy head of a megacorporation wants that power for a force of armored super-soldiers. There's not much universe-building going on beyond that--it's an entirely standalone story with a few scattered references to other existing superheroes, pretty similar to how most DC <em>and</em> MCU movies have been the past several years.</p><p dir="ltr">But while it's not really thinking about what else is currently going on in this new world, it does set up some things for the future, including a direct sequel tease. So while the new DC big screen universe is pretty small today, it won't stay that way for long. Let's look at what happened in Blue Beetle and what it might mean for the future.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: Everything after this point is spoilers.</strong></p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blue-beetle-ending-and-mid-credits-scene-explained/1100-6516986/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Bloom said there are already plans for stories to be told in future games with Modern Warfare's now-iconic characters.</p><p dir="ltr">"We think of character arcs as going one way, but they can also fall off their arc, they can go backwards, people can evolve and devolve," Bloom said. "All these things, they offer rich, fertile ground to tell stories, and that's not going to stop. In fact, I would say we're just getting started."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-4-is-already-being-teased/1100-6516979/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Stirs Up Infamous "No Russian" Controversy

<p>Activision has officially announced Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, and it looks like the game is going to stir up some controversy once again over its connection to the "No Russian" mission from 2009's Modern Warfare II.</p><p>For anyone just catching up, the 2009 game featured a mission in which villain Vladimir Makarov leads a massacre in an airport where he opens fire on everyone in sight. Players control an undercover CIA agent and can choose to take part in the bloodshed or stand by without firing their weapon, but still witnessing the violence. Trying to stop the attackers ends the mission. This mission generated a lot of controversy, and, with Makarov returning in Modern Warfare III, it seems history is repeating itself.</p><p>The post-credits scene in 2022's Modern Warfare II took place on an airplane, with an unidentified person assembling a pistol before receiving a text from "M" asking if they were ready to carry out a mission. "M," who is surely Makarov, replies to the hijacker, "No Russian."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-stirs-up-infamous-no-russian-controversy/1100-6516977/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Blasphemous 2 Review - Unholy Pilgrimage

<p dir="ltr">Whether it's a giant woman willfully letting the Children of Moonlight deglove one of her hands; a bearded man leaking golden honey out of gaping wounds in his palms, face, and back; or a vendor that's simply an arm protruding from a towering pile of goods, developer The Game Kitchen has a knack for creating surreal pixel art imagery. Blasphemous 2 sees the Seville-based studio delve further into Andalusian and Spanish culture, iconography, and folklore to concoct a gothic, quasi-Catholic world that's as gruesome as it is fascinating. Inspired by the religious paintings of Francisco Goya and the architecture of cities like Seville and Cadiz, Blasphemous 2 follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, mixing its unique and harrowing aesthetic with a gameplay amalgam of Metroidvanias and Souls-likes. Where the first game faltered, however, its sequel makes significant improvements, resulting in a thrilling adventure that doesn't run out of steam.</p><p dir="ltr">As solid as the original game was, monotony did seep into its latter half due to a lack of variety--with one-dimensional combat limited by a single weapon--and some frustrating platforming. Thankfully, Blasphemous 2 rectifies both of these issues by introducing a robust combat system in tandem with more varied traversal that doesn't rely on an overabundance of spike traps. You'll still encounter the occasional pitfall intended to punish mistimed leaps, but plunging onto a bed of jagged spikes doesn't result in instant death anymore. This is a crucial change since an expanded repertoire of abilities has resulted in more demanding platforming, yet you're unlikely to feel disheartened if you do make a mistake while traversing this labyrinthine world.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to story, Blasphemous 2 is as obfuscated as its predecessor. Much of its heady lore can be interpreted from dialogue with friendly NPCs and loquacious item descriptions, but if you're anything like me, you'll need an in-depth lore video to fully grasp it all. Nevertheless, the setup is rather simple. Picking up right where Blasphemous' Wounds of Eventide DLC left off, Blasphemous 2 begins with the return of the all-powerful deity known as The Miracle, who is prophesied to give birth to a so-called miracle child. This forces The Penitent One to awaken from his final resting place in order to slay the unholy newborn and every other grotesque monstrosity in his path. Along the way, myriad NPCs will shine a faint light on the mysterious new world the Penitent One finds himself in and its hidden secrets, but only if you choose to seek out these ancillary threads. Much like the inscrutable fables of From Software, you'll only take out as much as you're willing to put in. This style of storytelling isn't for everyone, but even if you can't or aren't willing to comprehend all of its machinations, the tales you do fully engage with are likely to engross.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blasphemous-2-review-unholy-pilgrimage/1900-6418101/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> via mouse and keyboard is very much an isometric RPG, complete with a zoomed out, birds-eye view of the action and players moving characters via clicks of the mouse. But what if that weren't the case?</p><p dir="ltr">Thanks to modders, Larian Studio's hit RPG can be transformed to feel more akin to something like BioWare's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-origins/">Dragon Age: Origins</a> or CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/">The Witcher 3</a>, complete with a more zoomed in, third-person camera and WASD movement controls.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">As highlighted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/baldurs-gate-3-modders-have-added-wasd-controls-letting-you-jog-around-the-sword-coast-like-its-an-mmo//">PC Gamer</a>, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/781">WASD Character Movement</a> mod from Ch4nKyy and the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/945">Native Camera Tweaks</a> mod by Ershin combined change Baldur's Gate 3 into what feels like a completely different game. With Native Camera Tweaks installed, players can choose to zoom in for a more traditional third-person perspective while running around the world of Baldur's Gate 3 and interacting with its various inhabitants. This way, they can notice all the little details that are almost impossible to notice from the game's default camera angle. Even better, players always have the option to zoom back out to a more isometric view as they see fit, like in combat.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/these-baldurs-gate-3-mods-make-larians-hit-rpg-feel-more-like-dragon-age/1100-6516972/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## The Death Wall Reign Of Terror Has Finally Been Stopped In Hitman

<p>When it comes to murder, Hitman games are a toybox of creative carnage that you can inflict on terrible people and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sean-bean-who-definitely-never-dies-is-hitman-2s-f/1100-6462606/">actors like Sean Bean</a>. But not all of the ways that characters can die are intentional; in Hitman 2's Isle of Sgail level, there's a particular wall that unintentionally kills anyone who comes into contact with it. Developer IO Interactive has dubbed this the Death Wall and has tried different means of addressing the issue before finally arriving at a creative--and mundane--solution: stacking up a bunch of boxes to block it off (via <a href="https://twitter.com/npurkeypile/status/1692155157113385330">Nate Purkeypile</a> on Twitter).</p><p>"Ironically enough, the death wall is located in the Morgue and would kill any NPC who was right up against it,"<a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman?panel=hitman/patch-notes/2023/hitman-woa-august-patch-notes"> IO Interactive explained</a> in the patch notes for Hitman: World of Assassination's new update. "To remedy this, we added some extra collision along the wall--but that didn’t work. We could see that NPCs were able to step *just* outside of the navmesh bounds (basically the area that they are allowed to be) and although we tried a few other changes, the Death Wall kept on claiming victims."</p><p>So how did IO Interactive repair the merciless wall? The solution was to place a bunch of boxes next to the wall, which keeps NPCs from falling victim to architectural assassination. Despite this fix, there is still a clear and present danger present here, and the Death Wall patiently waits to claim another life. This isn't the first time that developers have had to think outside of the box when it comes to solving issues in games, with one classic example being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesdas-todd-howard-shares-wild-trick-that-let-morrowind-run-on-xbox/1100-6482559/">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind rebooting your Xbox during loading screens</a> to avoid running into memory issues.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-death-wall-reign-of-terror-has-finally-been-stopped-in-hitman/1100-6516965/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## 10 Movies That Took So Much Time To Actually Make And Release

<p><h2>10 Movies That Took Forever To Make</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4179546-alita-battle-angel.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Movies take a long time to make--all those actors, the crew, props and sets, and of course a script are required before filming kicks off--it's a lot of spinning plates to keep in the air all at once, and many movies never make it to full production because the process is so complicated. That's especially the case when it comes to blockbuster pictures. Even a relatively smooth production can take three or more years to get from the greenlight to the finish line.</p><p dir="ltr">And while some movies are just work for most of the people involved, others become passion projects. An actor knows they were born to play a given character, or a director has a clear vision to bring an idea to life on the silver screen. These movies can take a lot longer to make just because someone involved has a very particular vision of what they want to see, or because the people signing the checks don't really "get it."</p><p dir="ltr">These movies can drag on for years or even decades, and even then they can still fall apart. But the movies in this list actually made it out of production and onto moviegoers' screens, both big and small. They all spent a lot of time in development, though.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. The Flash</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4179552-the-flash.jpg" /><br /><h3><ul><li>First Mention: 2013</li><li>Began Filming: 2021</li><li>Released to Theaters: 2023</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Time Passed: 10 years</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">When the MCU was gaining steam, DC Comics and Warner Bros. sought to put together their own universe of superhero movies. The plan was for Zack Snyder to lead the charge. At that time, The Flash was announced alongside a slate of other movies including Aquaman, Batman, and Cyborg. While the films and events that followed that announcement are well known by this point, The Flash had the most tumultuous journey from announcement to screen of all. Some films, like Cyborg, were canceled entirely. The Flash, somehow, stuck around. The movie went through a bunch of different directors before landing on It director Andy Muschietti. Even after filming in 2021, the drama continued as Ezra Miller's public life became the source of many headlines. The movie finally made it to theaters in 2023, for better or worse.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Schindler's List</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4179551-schindlers-list.jpg" /><br /><h3><ul><li dir="ltr">First Mention: 1983</li><li dir="ltr">Began Filming: 1993</li><li dir="ltr">Released to Theaters: 1993</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Time Passed: 10 years</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Sometimes, movies take forever to make and are somehow still right on schedule. Steven Spielberg first heard about Oskar Schindler in 1983 when MCA president Sid Sheinberg sent him a review of the book Schindler's Ark. Poldek Pfefferberg, one of the children rescued by Schindler, had been attempting to get a movie made for the story since 1963, and when he met with Spielberg in 1983, the director told him the movie would be made in 10 years. In the intervening time, Spielberg shopped the movie around to various directors, including Roman Polanski and Martin Scorsese, thinking that he wasn't mature enough to make the film himself. Scorsese was attached to direct it at one point, but Spielberg later did a trade--1991's Cape Fear remake for Scorsese, and Schindler's List back into his hands. Scorsese handed the film back to Spielberg, who felt ready to handle the film, who would go on to release it in 1993 as predicted.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Avatar: The Way of Water</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4179547-avatar-2.jpg" /><br /><h3><ul><li dir="ltr">First Mention: 2010</li><li dir="ltr">Began Filming: 2017</li><li dir="ltr">Released to Theaters: 2022</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Time Passed: 12 years</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">The main reason behind Avatar: The Way of Water's long development time is James Cameron himself. Just look at the development of Alita: Battle Angel! After the wild success of Avatar that made it the highest-grossing movie of all time worldwide, Fox executives were likely eager to get a sequel out while the getting was good. That didn't happen, though. When you've made as many record-breaking, technological envelope-pushing movies as Cameron, you get to be one of the very few people in Hollywood that essentially gets to do whatever they want. There are very, very few directors that can boast the level of freedom Cameron has.</p><p dir="ltr">After Avatar, pre-production and production on the sequel were subject to numerous delays. One cause in particular was Cameron's determination to get the look of CGI set underwater looking just right. Cameron has been obsessed with technology for most of his career, from the groundbreaking CGI of Terminator 2 to the technical challenges of Titanic. Cameron seems to be at least as interested in doing something brand new with each of his films as he is in simply making them. In theory, though, this long wait means a shorter wait for the third, fourth, and fifth Avatar movies. Cameron wrote scripts for all of the movies and got the CGI technology to a place he's satisfied with. But with Cameron's penchant for throwing in new technical challenges, we'll believe Avatar 3 is coming on schedule in 2025 when we see a trailer.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Boyhood</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4179549-boyhood.jpg" /><br /><h3><ul><li dir="ltr">First Mention: 2002</li><li dir="ltr">Began Filming: 2002</li><li dir="ltr">Released to Theaters: 2014</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Time passed: 12 years</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Linear time is a cruel thing, always moving more quickly or more slowly than we'd like. Richard Linklater had no choice but to succumb to it when he decided to make Boyhood. In 2002, Linklater announced Boyhood, a movie that would follow a boy from first grade up through high-school graduation. The crew would film for a few weeks each year. While Linklater wanted the movie to end with the young adult's graduation, he knew that people change over time and was willing to tweak the story as filming continued each year. Boyhood was also created during an incredibly tumultuous time in filmmaking in terms of technology. Extensive use of computers in making and showing movies was just getting going in 2002, and it was at full steam by the time 2014 rolled around. If Linklater had stuck with whatever was new and shiny across that 12-year period, then Boyhood would've had a bunch of distinct looks due to the differences in cameras, film types, and post-production technology. To avoid the movie showing the advancement of technology used to make it, Linklater filmed things entirely in 35mm. Boyhood finally released in 2014, with critics bringing attention to both the unique technical scope and intimate story of the film, and it holds a 100 rating on Metacritic as a result.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Mad Max: Fury Road</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4179550-madmax-furyroad.jpg" /><br /><h3><ul><li dir="ltr">First Mention: 1987</li><li dir="ltr">Began Filming: 2012</li><li dir="ltr">Released to Theaters: 2015</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Time Passed: 15 years</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">In 1981's Mad Max: The Road Warrior, George Miller created the still-enduring look for post-apocalyptic movies from almost whole cloth. The costumes, repurposed technology, cobbled-together settlements, and many other elements form the basis for the Fallout game series and many other games and movies. Miller made Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome next, and then in 1987 had the idea for Mad Max: Fury Road--a Mad Max movie that would be a continuous chase. Miller took a break from directing movies in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and returned instead to direct family dramas and CGI movies, like Lorenzo's Oil, Babe: A Pig in the City, and Happy Feet for the next 25 years. Bits and pieces came to him, and he worked with storyboard artists to put 3,500 shots together. Filming on Fury Road was set to begin in</p><p dir="ltr">In 1981's Mad Max: The Road Warrior, George Miller created the still-enduring look for post-apocalyptic movies from almost whole cloth.

Bits and pieces came to him, and he worked with storyboard artists to put 3,500 shots together. Filming on Fury Road was set to begin in 2001, but according to Miller himself, 9/11 put the movie on ice due to the collapse of the American dollar and heightened security requirements. The movie sat for years and Mel Gibson aged out of the role by both Miller's and his own admission. The movie shifted to being an animated feature for a time before shifting back to live action. Tom Hardy was cast in 2010, and filming finally began in 2012. Mad Max: Fury Road hit theaters in 2015 to nearly universal critical acclaim, and would take home six Academy Awards--the most for any film that year and the most for any Australian production ever.. While Miller had the first idea almost 30 years before the movie came out, the 2001 production time makes the most sense here--Fury Road took 14 years to get made.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Black Adam</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4179548-black-adam.jpg" /><br /><h3><ul><li dir="ltr">First Mention: 2007</li><li dir="ltr">Began Filming: 2021</li><li dir="ltr">Released to Theaters: 2022</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Time passed: 15 years</strong></li></ul><p>If you don't pay attention to superhero movies, it might seem like the Dwayne Johnson vehicle Black Adam came out of nowhere--The Rock was finally getting in on the superhero trend after all this time. But the truth is, Johnson had been working on this project since before the MCU even had a name. As the movie hit theaters in 2022, Johnson <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cj2T577OPLz/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=d3c85463-308e-472d-9317-ba7ffddf8d29">shared a screenshot</a> from the first press coverage of the movie in November 2007, prior to even the release of 2008's Iron Man. In the same post, Johnson called out Black Adam's status as an anti-hero of color as being something that has excited him about the character since he was a child. Johnson was attached to the Shazam film back in 2014, and then to a standalone Black Adam film. They had a script by 2018, and shooting was to begin in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic delayed it into 2021. Once the film got rolling, things moved quickly, with shooting lasting from April to August of 2021. The movie hit theaters with a resounding thud, however, and was the last appearance of Henry Cavill's Superman, and part of his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-wont-be-returning-as-superman/1100-6510069/">long-tenuous connection</a> to the DC universe of films--which would undergo a massive change just weeks later as Peter Safran and James Gunn became co-presidents of DC Studios, leaving the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-rock-explains-what-happened-with-black-adam-vortex-of-new-leadership/1100-6516640/">potential for a Black Adam sequel</a> in question.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Alita: Battle Angel</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4179546-alita-battle-angel.jpg" /><br /><h3><ul><li dir="ltr">First Mention: 2003</li><li dir="ltr">Began Filming: 2017</li><li dir="ltr">Released to Theaters: 2019</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Time passed: 16 years</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">As noted above, few directors love big, messy, technology-driven projects the way James Cameron does. Avatar and its one sequel (so far) are the movies most typically associated with Cameron's penchant for long-running projects, but there's another that is often overlooked: Alita: Battle Angel. Based on Yukito Kishiro's manga, Gunnm (Battle Angel Alita in its English-speaking release), Cameron first announced his intent to direct an Alita movie in 2003. All that stood in his way at the time was finishing up the Dark Angel series, which starred Jessica Alba in one of her breakout roles. In 2005, however, Cameron announced that he was giving priority to what was then called Project 880--the first title for what would become 2009's Avatar. Avatar only took another five years to make, but it also made a billion dollars at the box office, and Cameron's attention kept getting pulled away from Alita. Eventually, he relinquished directing duties to Robert Rodriguez (Sin City, From Dusk Til Dawn), and shooting finally began in 2016. After a delay, Alita hit theaters in January 2019--just a few months less than 16 years after Cameron announced his intent to direct the film.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. A.I. Artificial Intelligence</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4179545-ai_1280x720.png" /><br /><h3><ul><li dir="ltr">First Mention: Late 1970s</li><li dir="ltr">Began Filming: 2001</li><li dir="ltr">Released to Theaters: 2001</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Time passed: 20+ years</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Stanley Kubrick was notoriously meticulous and secretive about his movies, and he often took his time making them. The story that would become A.I. Artificial Intelligence, Supertoys Last All Summer Long by Brian Aldiss, was written in 1969, and Kubrick began developing the movie in the late 1970s. After nearly 20 years, the movie was to begin development in 1994. After a series of delays, Kubrick asked Steven Spielberg to take over the project, but he chose to focus on other projects and instead persuaded Kubrick to stay in the director's chair. Kubrick filmed Eyes Wide Shut instead, following concerns about CGI visual effects being able to tell the story he wanted. After Kubrick's passing in 1999, his wife Christine asked Spielberg to take the project on, at which point he accepted it. Things moved quickly from there, with the movie both filming and releasing in 2001.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. The Meg</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4179553-the-meg.jpg" /><br /><h3><ul><li dir="ltr">First Mention: 1996</li><li dir="ltr">Began Filming: 2016</li><li dir="ltr">Released to Theaters: 2018</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Time passed: 22 years</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Based on the 1997 novel Meg: A Novel of Deep Terror, The Meg was in development for a long time before it finally made it to screen with Jason Statham starring. Disney acquired rights to the book almost immediately upon release and had a couple of scripts developed before the rights reverted to the author, Steve Alten. New Line Cinema tried it next, but ultimately canceled the picture due to budgetary concerns, and the rights eventually went back to the author again. The Meg remained submerged for another decade, before it resurfaced in 2015. This time it stuck, with Jon Turtletaub directing and Jason Statham starring. Filming began in 2016, and The Meg arrived in theaters in 2018.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. The Up Documentaries</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4179554-up-series.jpg" /><br /><h3><ul><li dir="ltr">First Mention: 1964</li><li dir="ltr">Last installment: 2019</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Time Passed: 55 Years</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Like Boyhood, the whole point of the Up documentaries was tracking someone's life in real time. While Boyhood was a fictional life that developed alongside a real one, though, the Up documentaries, filmed for the BBC in Britain, tracked the lives of 20 children as they grew up. The documentary caught up with as many of the members as possible throughout the years. Some asked not to participate further, while others passed away or were unavailable. Only 10 of the 20 children were available for all 10 installments. The final episode, which caught up with the children at age 63, was filmed and released in 2019. No plans are currently made to film a "70" episode, following the death of the director, Michael Apted, in 2021.</p></h3></p><br />

## Alan Wake 2 Delayed, Still Launching Before Halloween

<p>October is a highly competitive month for video game launches every single year, and that's true this year once again. Seemingly for that reason, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alan-wake-ii/">Alan Wake 2</a> is getting delayed--but just barely--moving from its original date of October 17 to its new date of October 27. The news was shared by Remedy on <a href="https://twitter.com/alanwake/status/1692174551466316121">social media</a>.</p><div><p>"We’re moving Alan Wake 2’s launch from October 17 to October 27. October is an amazing month for game launches and we hope this date shift gives more space for everyone to enjoy their favorite games.</p><p dir="ltr">We can’t wait to show you what everyone’s favorite novelist is up to in the Dark Place next week. Thanks for your patience!"</p></div><p>That still puts the game on track to debut during the pre-Halloween spooky season, which should fit the survival-horror game quite nicely. With games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2/">Spider-Man 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage/">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> launching within days of Alan Wake 2's original date, the move to the back end of October may help Remedy's sequel avoid the same fate as the original game, which launched alongside Red Dead Redemption in 2010.</p><p>By "next week," Remedy means Gamescom, at which the team behind Alan Wake 2 is scheduled to debut a new gameplay demo showcasing the titular writer's trek through the Dark Place. Earlier this year, we saw our first glimpse of gameplay in a segment dedicated to the new playable co-protagonist, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/alan-wake-2-saga-anderson-official-gameplay/2300-6461592/">Saga Anderson</a>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2-delayed-still-launching-before-halloween/1100-6516944/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Starfield Is Playable On Xbox One, Here's How

<p>Bethesda's big new RPG, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a>, is coming to Xbox Series X|S and PC, but what about the Xbox One? The spacefaring game won't be on the last-gen console natively, but the game will still be playable through the console by way of streaming when it releases in September.</p><p>People who are signed up to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate can stream the game at launch. The game might be too beefy for the Xbox One, but thanks to streaming, the hard work is being done off site and your Xbox One acts as the streaming delivery mechanism. This also means there is no need to download the game at all--and that's a big deal since it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-file-size-revealed-and-its-very-big/1100-6516954/">weighs in at more than 100 GB. </a></p><p>The quality of your game experience, though, will depend upon the strength and consistency of your internet connection. Another thing to be aware of is that streaming via the cloud could eat into your data allowance, if you're not on an unlimited plan.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-is-playable-on-xbox-one-heres-how/1100-6516957/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Red Dead Redemption On PS4 And PS5 Is A "Bare-Bones" Upgrade According To Technical Analysis

<p>Red Dead Redemption, Rockstar's 2010 cowboy adventure, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-preorder-nintendo-switch-playstation-4/1100-6516626/">is now available on PlayStation consoles</a>--and Nintendo Switch--but how does it measure up to the Xbox backward-compatible versions? On Xbox Series X and Xbox One X, Red Dead Redemption has a 4K presentation--1440p on Xbox Series S--and on PS5 and PS4, several key improvements are evident according to the game analysts at Digital Foundry.</p><div>          </div><p>While a small list of enhancements are noticeable, Digital Foundry noted that much more could have been done to improve the 13-year-old game. As the group explained, the Xbox backward-compatible version of Red Dead Redemption is the Xbox 360 edition of the game with a higher resolution, anisotropic filtering, and a negative LOD bias that enhances specific textures.</p><p>While the PS4 Pro version--which is used for the PS5 version--does have better shadows in comparison and a slightly different gamma presentation, the rest of the game "looks much the same" between the two consoles, according to Digital Foundry. "Models still have a sharp, slightly blocky character, with seventh-gen polygon budgets," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-red-dead-redemption-on-playstation-has-one-impressive-upgrade">Digital Foundry's Oliver Mackenzie explained</a>. "I couldn't make out any improvement in textures either, and the game still suffers from some very low-res artwork. This includes the main character, whose muddy face should have been a high priority to improve. LODs look about the same between the two releases, with grass extending far into the distance on both machines, but with some noticeable pop-in at times as well."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-on-ps4-and-ps5-is-a-bare-bones-upgrade-according-to-technical-analysis/1100-6516955/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Shadow Gambit - Best Crew Members To Revive First

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew/">Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew</a> allows you to unlock your party members in just about any order you'd like--but with a relatively large party with diverse power sets, some are bound to be more useful than others. You'll revive all of the crew aboard your ghost ship, the Red Marley, over the course of the first half of the campaign. But it's a lengthy process, and you'll probably want to unlock some of the better and more versatile members first, while saving specialists with narrow skill sets for later. We've ranked the crew members by which ones to revive first, based on both overall strength and general all-around skills.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Afia Manicato</strong></p><p dir="ltr">On this one, you don't have a choice. Afia is ostensibly the main character in Shadow Gambit, the one who interfaces with the Red Marley for major story sequences, and the ship's Navigator. She is also the one who will physically revive the rest. But Afia is a good yardstick by which to measure the rest of the crew. She comes equipped with a dash-attack that can target enemies from afar, and the ability to freeze an enemy temporarily for distraction or sneaking around them. Most of the characters have some form of special attack and distraction technique, so these are the basic building blocks that you'll see iterated on throughout.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-gambit-best-crew-members-to-revive-first/1100-6516936/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Last Of Us co-creator and showrunner Craig Mazin has talked about the future of the show in an interview with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-last-of-us-showrunner-season-two-casting-abby-1235560553/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, confirming there are still multiple seasons left for the Emmy-nominated adaptation. Mazin also hinted that the show has already found its Abby, though casting announcements have been put on hold by the strike.</p><p>When asked whether season two will be going back to ten episodes, or following the first season in only having nine, Mazin says "neither," elaborating that: "We've laid out our vision to HBO for how this series should lay out across not one season, but multiple seasons."</p><p>Having previously mentioned the idea of a fourth season in passing, Mazin is asked whether four seasons is the current plan for The Last Of Us. "You never know," he answers. "It can end up being three or five. But four seems like a good number. Some seasons, because of the story we’re telling, will need fewer episodes and some will need more."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-co-creator-says-show-could-be-3-to-5-seasons-long/1100-6516949/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
