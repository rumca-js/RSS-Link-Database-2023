<p>Just in time for the final stretch of back-to-school madness, Best Buy is holding a 3-day anniversary sale. From Friday through Sunday, you can pick up last-minute additions to your haul for all-time low prices (or very near them).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not every &ldquo;deal&rdquo; right now is a bargain, though&mdash;there&rsquo;s plenty of junk discounts in the mix. To help speed the process along, I took a peek at the sale and picked out a few that will help round out your tech gear for the coming academic year.</p>

## PC CPU market rebounds into ‘meh’ territory

<p>The PC CPU market set no new records for the second quarter of 2023, a researcher reports &mdash; and that&rsquo;s all for the best.</p>



<p>Mercury Research reported that in the <em>first</em> quarter of 2023, CPU shipments within the PC market sunk to their lowest point in a decade. But in the second quarter, CPU sales soared by 20 percent quarter-over-quarter to where they&rsquo;re expected to be &mdash; neither at the high nor low end of the scale, but somewhere in between. Another interesting wrinkle: Chromebook demand has begun surging again, according to Mercury principal analyst Dean McCarron.</p>



<p>McCarron didn&rsquo;t provide overall shipment totals, reserving those for paid clients.</p>



<p>In the ongoing horse race between AMD and Intel, Intel won: the company gained 5.1 percentage points of market share during the quarter, if Internet of Things and embedded SOCs (which AMD sells into game consoles) were factored out. In desktop CPUs, Intel gained 1.2 percentage points; in mobile, Intel&rsquo;s share soared by 8.1 percentage points.</p>



<p>McCarron cautioned, however, that his estimates come with some caveats. A major one: as the CPU market ramps back up again, any adjustments in share data are probably more likely due to retailers and other parts of the supply chain starting to come back to life &mdash; like a cold engine that sputters a bit before it catches.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Mercury Research Q2 2023 CPU market share" class="wp-image-2029530" height="650" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Mercury-Q2-2023-CPU-overall.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The overall CPU market share for Q2 2023, between AMD and Intel.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mercury Research</p></div>



<p>&ldquo;Please keep in mind that due to the inventory corrections taking place, that the statistics and share movements reported here in the past few quarters &mdash; and likely for the first half of 2023 &mdash; are more reflective of the suppliers differing in the depth and timing of their inventory corrections, rather than indicating sales-out share of the PC market, which is something we probably won&rsquo;t know with any  accuracy until late in 2023,&rdquo; McCarron wrote.</p>



<p>Intel saw sharp growth in low-end mobile processors, including Celeron and its new &ldquo;Intel Processor&rdquo; N-series chips, both of which go into Chromebooks, McCarron said. &ldquo;[A] ll signs are after a year-long lull, Chromebook demand for CPUs&ndash;both X86 and ARM &mdash; has increased dramatically in the past two quarters,&rdquo; McCarron said. </p>



<p>Apple&rsquo;s declining Mac sales complicated matters somewhat, as a shortfall in Arm-based Macs helped lower the overall share of Arm CPUs in the PC market from 15.4 percent to 12.5 percent. If you factor in Arm CPU sales, &ldquo;both AMD and Intel gained client share, with Intel in particular growing shipments in the Chromebook market far faster than ARM processors did,&rdquo; McCarron said.</p>

## Best VPNs for gaming 2023: Four great options

<p>We all know what VPNs are great for. They can help secure your internet traffic over public networks like at a caf&eacute;, airport, library, or other public place. VPNs can also get around geo-blocking in order to watch Netflix catalogs around the world, or access Disney Plus in a country that doesn&rsquo;t have it yet. Gaming is another popular use case for VPNs: Besides the privacy factor for gamers who use peer-to-peer networks, a VPN can give you a more stable experience since VPN servers are monitored and maintained for reliability; it can also help get around an ISP that tends to throttle traffic to game servers. (For more on this, see our section below: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/feed#do-you-need-a-vpn-for-gaming">Do you need a VPN for gaming?</a>)</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s what we suggest as the best VPNs for gaming. (Too see our VPN picks for all the various common use cases, check out our comprehensive <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html">best VPN roundup</a>.)</p>

<p>ExpressVPN is our top choice for the best VPN overall, and what makes it a good choice as a general VPN also helps when it comes to gaming. First, its speeds are in the top five in our download tests. Upload speeds are a bit weaker, retaining around 67 percent of the base speed when the top performers are around 80 percent. Still, ExpressVPN&rsquo;s upload speeds should be more than fast enough for gaming.</p>

<p>This VPN also has more than 3,000 servers in 95 countries around the world, giving this service a sizeable network. You should have no trouble finding a server that isn&rsquo;t too busy in most of the major countries. ExpressVPN costs about $100 per year, but if you want a VPN to make your gaming better it&rsquo;s worth it to pay the premium. Plus, there are a number of other advantages you can get from Express, which you can read about in our review.</p>

<p>A frequent choice as the top VPN from a number of critics, NordVPN is a very good choice for gaming. It has very fast download speeds and upload speeds (73 percent and 80 percent of base internet speeds, respectively), making it more than fast enough. NordVPN also has a wide range of servers with more than 5,000 total in over 60 country locations. NordVPN isn&rsquo;t quite as easy to use as ExpressVPN, but it&rsquo;s still easy enough to understand for both novice and expert users. It also offers split-tunneling, allowing you to route your web surfing traffic through the VPN while keeping your online gaming separate. This ensures you have the best of both worlds, privacy and speed.</p>

<p>If you want servers, servers, and more servers then Private Internet Access is the choice for you. PIA has over 10,000 servers at the moment. It also comes with one of the best feature sets of any VPN on the market. Their split-tunneling feature is a particular highlight and allows you to pick and choose which apps run through the VPN. This is a great way to keep your internet browsing private and secure connected to a VPN while running your games through your regular internet in order to optimize speeds and performance.</p>

<p>PIA&rsquo;s speeds were a bit lower than NordVPN and ExpressVPN, but they&rsquo;re still fast enough for gaming. PIA is a great choice when you want a massive amount of server choices and a feature set that allows you to optimize your gaming experience.</p>

<p>ProtonVPN is our top finisher for upload speeds. So if that&rsquo;s the main concern for you, this is your pick. It&rsquo;s also the second-place finisher for download speeds. However, its server choices are quite a bit more modest than the other VPNs mentioned in this roundup, with just over 1,500, meaning there will be times when most of its servers are at or near capacity, especially in the United States. The country count is a bit lower at 63, but most of the major destinations you need are here. It&rsquo;s also stable and quick to connect. ProtonVPN has several pricing tiers so be sure to pay attention to what each tier offers before buying.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>



<p>To test VPN speeds, we take the base download speed on three days, with each testing day having a minimum speed of 80 megabits per second (Mbps). Then we test the speeds three times each in five different countries on each testing day. These countries are often, but not always the U.S., the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan. </p>



<p>The daily speeds are averaged together to get a daily average speed. Then we take the average of each testing day to get an overall global average. That overall average is then expressed as a percentage of the base speed. That way the test results provide a sense of how much speed a VPN retains over multiple locations. We avoid hard numbers since speeds can vary so much based on factors such as your service provider, router, devices, and time of day.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-look-for-in-a-vpn-for-gaming">What to look for in a VPN for gaming</h2>



<p>For gaming there are a few essentials. The first is speed. If you don&rsquo;t have good speeds, your online experience will be terrible in general whether gaming or not. So excellent VPN speeds are a must.</p>



<p>The next big feature you need is stability, a VPN connection that gets online quickly and doesn&rsquo;t drop or slow down. To obtain stability you need a reliable service, but it also has to have a good number of servers. VPNs can often slow down as their servers get saturated with users. A larger network won&rsquo;t have that problem as much since it will automatically connect users to other servers that aren&rsquo;t seeing such heavy use. </p>



<p>If you have speed, stability, and a large server network to choose from then you&rsquo;re good to go. The only other thing you need is unlimited bandwidth, which means you need a paid service. Free VPNs have daily or monthly allotments, making them more or less useless for gaming. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="do-you-need-a-vpn-for-gaming">Do you need a VPN for gaming?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen what you need from a gaming VPN, but is this even something you need for your favorite online adventure or shoot &lsquo;em up?</p>



<p>The answer is, it all depends. One of the most common questions people have about VPNs and gaming is whether it will improve your ping times. That is, the speed, measured in milliseconds, that your PC can send data to the game&rsquo;s servers. VPNs can&rsquo;t really help here since it adds another connection point between you and your destination server. Instead of going from your PC to the game server and back, it goes from your PC to the VPN server to the game server and back. In most cases you will probably find that ping times either worsen or stay about the same. </p>



<p>Either way, it&rsquo;s a rare case where ping times are helped by a VPN. The one exception might be stability. In these instances, your bare internet connection isn&rsquo;t stable enough due to a high amount of activity in your neighborhood, or heavy load on your home network. In those cases, a VPN might make things a little more stable since you connection runs through a VPN server that specializes in keeping things moving.</p>



<p>That brings us to the next topic of potential ISP throttling. We&rsquo;re not talking about the nefarious kind where your service provider might try to charge you extra for access to gaming servers. Instead, we&rsquo;re talking about everyday traffic shaping, as well as penalizing bandwidth hogs (you) for taking up too much bandwidth at peak times.</p>



<p>Again in those cases a VPN may help. It all depends on how closely your ISP is monitoring your activity. If it&rsquo;s slowing down your connection to a specific server and prioritizing other traffic, then a VPN will most likely help. If, however, you&rsquo;re getting penalized for being too much of a bandwidth hog, the ISP will still see larger amounts of bandwidth and penalize you on that basis.</p>



<p>If your favorite time to play is 7PM at night, and that&rsquo;s a high traffic time, a VPN might help.</p>



<p>Another reason people love a VPN is for getting around geo-blocking restrictions. For the most part this is a bad idea or unnecessary for gaming. Many games already let you change regions freely, while others will only let you switch every few weeks. In those instances where you can&rsquo;t switch regions, and you want to try getting around geographic restrictions, keep in mind that your gameplay experience may not be that great. On top of that, you may be violating the games terms of service, setting yourself up for a ban. That goes for playing games and trying to get access to games early, as well as accessing DLC that isn&rsquo;t available where you are. It&rsquo;s up to you, but keep in mind there are risks to getting around geo restrictions in games. Plus game networks like Steam don&rsquo;t like this kind of activity, and the only thing worse than getting penalized by a game would be getting penalized by Steam.</p>



<p>One final issue is if you are playing a game that uses a peer-to-peer network instead of a client-server setup. These games aren&rsquo;t as common as they once were, but the fear here is that someone will find your IP address and try to kick you offline with a denial-of-service attack. A VPN would definitely help with that, and if you&rsquo;re experiencing something you think might be a DDoS then you could try playing with a VPN to see if it helps.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><br />How many servers should my VPN have?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>There is no set number of servers that make one VPN better than another. While VPN providers will often advertise the number of servers they have, this is largely a marketing gimmick and doesn&rsquo;t really equate to the quality of the VPN service itself. Things such as server location spread and server quality are as important if not more so than the quantity of available servers.</p>



<p>That being said, most of the major VPN providers offer between 3,000 to 5,000 or more servers. We recommend that you avoid any paid service under 1,000 servers as this may be an indication that the company is not yet well established, which could lead to reliability issues.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>In short, yes, a VPN can have an effect on your internet speeds. But nowadays it&rsquo;s the exception rather than the norm.</p>



<p>When you connect to a VPN, it re-routes your traffic through its own servers. Depending on where these servers are located, it can add extra distance for your traffic to travel to and from, leading to a higher ping. Also, VPNs encrypt your data, which can lead to slower download and upload speeds due to the time it takes to encrypt and decrypt your data&mdash;this can affect everything from page load times to video buffering speeds. Thankfully, advances in encryption technology and server optimization by modern VPN providers have lessened these impacts significantly.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>Yes! In the United States, and in most countries, using a VPN is legal. Some websites might try to block VPN connections, but this is just due to their own terms of use and it doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t try to use a VPN. Something to note, however: While using a VPN is legal, some of the activities done <em>while using</em> a VPN might be illegal. Activities such as downloading pirated copyrighted content or accessing dark web markets are both illegal with or without a VPN.</p>

## Windows 11’s Cortana is dead, and it’s you who will pull the plug

<p>If you want to say goodbye to Cortana one last time within Windows 11, don&rsquo;t update the app.</p>



<p>Microsoft began <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2018918/microsoft-begins-pulling-the-plug-on-cortana.html">deprecating the Cortana app</a> within the Windows Insider program just a short time ago &mdash; that&rsquo;s programmer-speak for &ldquo;getting rid of,&rdquo; just like &ldquo;layoff&rdquo; or &ldquo;workforce reduction&rdquo; is HR-speak for the same thing. You can still open the Cortana app on Windows 11, but be careful.</p>



<p>On the top of the app you may notice that Cortana has an update available. If you ignore the update (for now), Cortana should continue to work as she&rsquo;s supposed to for the time being. But if you apply the update, you&rsquo;ll essentially kill Cortana.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Cortana app Windows 11" class="wp-image-2029482" height="910" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cortana-app-update.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>That &ldquo;new version available&rdquo; prompt holds a dark secret&hellip;</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>After applying the update, you can reopen the Cortana app. But if you do so, you&rsquo;ll see a message about how Cortana is now deprecated. At this point, you may as well uninstall the app itself, as Cortana is now effectively dead. That&rsquo;s a huge bummer for a Friday, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Cortana app Windows 11" class="wp-image-2029483" height="961" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cortana-deprecated.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>&hellip;it kills Cortana.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Cortana had personality. She had a voice. She was the face of Windows for years, even if she was eventually transformed into something of a monster in the <em>Halo</em> games themselves. Now, Microsoft has replaced Cortana with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1808784/1808784.html">Bing Chat</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1974843/windows-copilot-cant-decide-what-it-is.html">Windows Copilot</a>, which is now sort of a soulless corporate bot, there to help you and not much more. Rest in peace, Cortana.</p>

## Intel Downfall: Fix for severe CPU flaw drastically lowers performance

<p>As expected, microcode applied to fix the Intel &ldquo;Downfall&rdquo; bug a Google researcher discovered this week can have a severe impact on performance, according to early tests, with the performance hit reaching nearly 40 percent in select workloads. </p>



<p>That will pose a tough choice to consumers: if they accept Downfall BIOS patches from their system and motherboard makers to fix the problem, the performance of their CPUs could be severely affected. But they otherwise risk an attacker taking advantage of the latest CPU vulnerability to attack their PC. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2025589/downfall-serious-security-vulnerability-in-billions-of-intel-cpus-how-to-protect-yourself.html">The Downfall bug</a> affects <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/software-security-guidance/processors-affected-consolidated-product-cpu-model.html&amp;xcust=2-1-2029412-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">a majority of PCs</a>, from the 6th-gen &ldquo;Skylake&rdquo; Core chips up through the 11th-gen &ldquo;Tiger Lake&rdquo; processors.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s what the early tests, conducted by a single researcher at Phoronix, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.phoronix.com/review/intel-downfall-benchmarks/5&amp;xcust=2-1-2029412-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">have found</a>. They conducted three tests, on the Intel Xeon Platinum 8380, Xeon Gold 6226R, and the Core i7-1165G7. The latter chip was the only consumer processor the researcher tested.</p>



<p>Because Phoronix generally chose Linux server benchmarks, the three tests used aren&rsquo;t familiar ones to consumers: OpenVKL 1.3.1, an Intel volume computational benchmark; and two subtests of OPSRay, a ray-tracing benchmark. In the OpenVKL test, performance dropped by 11 percent after applying the Downfall microcode patch; in OPSRay, performance fell by 39 percent and 19 percent, respectively, after the fix was applied.</p>



<p>Officially, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/resources/gds-mitigation-performance-analysis.html&amp;xcust=2-1-2029412-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Intel does acknowledge</a> that the Downfall patch will lower performance in specific applications, including graphic design and video editing software. </p>



<p>&ldquo;Heavily optimized applications that rely on vectorization and gather instructions to achieve the highest performance may see an impact with the GDS mitigation update,&rdquo; Intel says. &ldquo;These are applications like graphical libraries, binaries, and video editing software that might use gather instructions. Our analysis has identified some specialized cases where client applications may see a performance impact. For example, certain digital art application add-ons have shown some performance impact. However, most client applications are not expected to be noticeably impacted because gather instructions are not typically used in the hot path.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All of this is troubling, especially if you already own an older processor. (Intel&rsquo;s 12th-gen Core and 13th-gen Core chips aren&rsquo;t affected by Downfall, either.) There&rsquo;s another wrinkle, too: the CVE-2022-40982  <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://downfall.page/&amp;xcust=2-1-2029412-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">(&ldquo;Downfall&rdquo;) vulnerability</a> allows a user who shares a PC to steal data from other users who share the same computer.. Daniel Moghimi, the Google researcher who discovered the vulnerability, hasn&rsquo;t yet reported that Downfall allows a remote attacker to steal data from your PC, though if you get tricked into installing malware on your PC, you could fall victim to the exploit.</p>



<p>That should give some comfort to those who live alone or don&rsquo;t share their PC with anyone else, though you should make sure <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407277/best-antivirus-for-windows-pc.html">your antivirus software</a> stays active and updated. (AV likely won&rsquo;t detect Downfall exploits, but can find malware loads trying to sneak onto your system.) It&rsquo;s a critical vulnerability for cloud providers, however; those servers are shared with multiple users, all tapping the same CPUs for a variety of applications.</p>



<p>So do you need to apply the Downfall patch? We can&rsquo;t say for sure. You&rsquo;ll have to assess your own risk and any performance penalties that a Downfall patch might cause. Moghimi, the Google researcher who discovered Downfall, recommends it however. Here is the answer to the question &ldquo;can I disable the mitigation if my workload does not use Gather&rdquo; on the dedicated Downfall page:<br /><br />&ldquo;This is a bad idea. Even if your workload does not use vector instructions, modern CPUs rely on vector registers to optimize common operations, such as copying memory and switching register content, which leaks data to untrusted code exploiting Gather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to think that all USB-C cables are the same, and that any promotional differences are just a way to hike up prices. After all, it&rsquo;s <em>just a cable</em>, right?</p>



<p>This is a common belief, but it&rsquo;s actually not correct. We&rsquo;ve tested numerous USB-C cables and we can say with certainty they are <em>not</em> all the same. In fact, we noticed huge performance differences among cables both in regards to charging devices and transferring data.</p>



<p>But with so many options available, how do you know which USB-C cables are the best? To get to the bottom of it, we tested a bunch of cables ranging from the biggest, most-recognizable brand-names to the cheapest of the cheap and put them through the wringer to see which came out on top. We identified some clear winners, which we&rsquo;ve highlighted below to help make the decision easier.</p>



<p>To avoid any confusion, we&rsquo;ve separated our picks into two groups: USB-C cables suitable for charging, and those suitable for both charging <em>and</em>&nbsp;fast data transfer&mdash;the difference basically comes down to USB-C 2.0 vs. 3.1. For further information you can refer to our guide on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3622451/how-to-buy-a-usb-c-cable-on-amazon.html">how to buy a USB-C cable on Amazon without losing your mind</a>, and you can find out more about how we test cables below our picks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, most people don&rsquo;t need a USB-C to USB-C cable for much more than charging devices&mdash;so why the premium for all that high-speed data-transfer, Thunderbolt stuff? Look no further than the Amazon Basics &ldquo;Aluminum Braided&rdquo; 100W USB-C to USB-C 2.0 cable then. Before you get too excited, the &ldquo;aluminum&rdquo; in its name probably should be &ldquo;aluminum-colored&rdquo;&mdash;if you wanted an actual aluminum exterior, you won&rsquo;t get it. This is a pleasant, shiny cloth-like braid. The cable features a stiff plastic overmold for strain relief and is wired strictly for USB 2.0 data transfer speeds. That means you should expect no more than 480Mbps versus the much faster 5Gbps to 40Gbps of cables wired for higher speeds.</p>

<p>The good news is that as a charging cable, you&rsquo;ll be able to charge up to 100 watts&mdash;enough power for a Dell XPS 15 or MacBook Pro 16-class laptop. Although our testing didn&rsquo;t find it to be quite as good as the Javex cable we&rsquo;re bumping from our top perch&mdash;it&rsquo;s close enough it doesn&rsquo;t matter. During testing, we also subjected the Amazon Basics Aluminum Braided cable to a continuous 100-watt load for more than 30 minutes without issue so charging won&rsquo;t be a problem.  Even better, it&rsquo;s less than half the cost of the Javex charging cable we previously recommended for those on a budget. Sure, it&rsquo;s not quite as pliable as the even more basic Amazon Basics cable USB 3 to USB-C below, this one is currently cheaper, isn&rsquo;t limited to 60 watts, and doesn&rsquo;t feel like it will fall apart.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be honest, we didn&rsquo;t know what to expect of the stock 6.6-foot Apple USB-C Charge Cable Apple includes with its MacBook laptops and sells as a replacement item. Yes, we&rsquo;ve heard the stories and seen the pictures of the sleeving on many Apple cables that fall off if you look at them too hard.</p>

<p>In the end, Apple&rsquo;s USB-C Charge Cable won us over and is actually our recommended cable for those who want a big name on the box and intend to use it for mostly charging. When we say the box, we mean it, because Apple oddly doesn&rsquo;t include any branding on the cable itself, which is a mistake because you just might mix it up with a lousy cable.</p>

<p>In the end though, it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s inside a cable that matters the most and the Apple USB-C cable has top-notch wiring materials that can deliver the most power to your laptop, phone, or tablet. Want to charge your laptop at 100 watts all day? That shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem for the Apple USB-C Charge Cable.</p>

<p>Obviously, as a charge cable it&rsquo;s terrible for data transfer and can&rsquo;t drive Thunderbolt devices nor your monitor, but as a charging cable it&rsquo;s excellent.</p>

<p>Another ding is its price of $19, but if you want a name-brand cable, it&rsquo;s hard to beat this. Plus you can buy it from an Apple store or retailer so you know you&rsquo;re actually getting what you paid for and not some counterfeit.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a high-quality USB-C cable that will give you excellent performance, it&rsquo;s hard to beat Cable Matters 6-foot USB-C cable. The cable can do it all and do it all well (well, almost) from charging at up to 100 watts, transferring data from your USB 3.1 SSD, or running a monitor. The only area where it doesn&rsquo;t excel is in Thunderbolt performance, which is limited to 20Gbps. That&rsquo;s not a ding in our book because that&rsquo;s the tradeoff of a 6-foot cable. To hit 40Gbps, you&rsquo;d have to step down to a shorter cable.</p>

<p>The other cost of this quality is weight and pliability. The cable weighs almost 3.5 ounces, making it the the heaviest cable we tested outside of the 4-meter (13-foot) cable we looked at above. Those thicker gauge wires also mean you can&rsquo;t roll up as easily or compactly as other cables, too.</p>

<p>And no surprise, high performance and high quality mean it&rsquo;s not cheap. At $18, it&rsquo;s among the more expensive cables here. But if performance and quality is your jam, the Cable Matters 6-foot USB-C cable will have you humming.</p>

<p>Cable Matters USB3 Cable is but 2.6-foot so it lacks the appeal of long cables. What appealed to us enough to buy the cable is its USB4 rating which promises high-performance.</p>

<p>And no surprise, the cable was able to charge our laptop at 100 watts, and offered the best voltage and lowest resistance thanks to the wires Cable Matters uses and its 2.6-foot length. That also translated into excellent USB 3.1 data transfer rates, monitor support and the only cable here capable of driving our Thunderbolt 3 SSD at a full 40Gbps data rates.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for high-performance in all things and don&rsquo;t mind the length, the Cable Matters USB4 cable is our pick.</p>

<p>Its weaknesses are its stiff feel thanks to the higher-quality, thicker wires and construction Cable Matters uses, and its price. Looked at in dollars-per-foot, this $20 cable is about $8 per foot. With the Amazon Basics USB 3.1 USB-C cable below, you&rsquo;re only paying $3.17 per foot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That Amazon cable can&rsquo;t match the Cable Matters USB4 in Thunderbolt performance, but few need it. That makes the cable best suited to niche areas but it&rsquo;s fast nonetheless with excellent construction.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to like about the Amazon Basics USB 3.1 Gen 1 USB-C cable. This 6-foot cable features rubber sleeving and hefty wires that give it a substantive feel without the stiffness you get from some cables.</p>

<p>Its Amazon Basics logo helps prevent you from mixing up this cable with the generic cables you have laying around, and the SuperSpeed logo assures you it&rsquo;s fast for data transfers.</p>

<p>In our testing, we were able to able to push the limits of our USB 3.2 10Gbps&nbsp; SSD and could also drive our 240Hz 1080p panel. It also was capable of driving our high-performance Thunderbolt 3 drive at its 20Gbps data rate but not at its 40Gbps data rate&mdash;which is expected of a 6-foot cable. And despite its USB 5Gbps rating, we could hit 10Gbps speeds anyway which says the cable&rsquo;s signal integrity is good despite its length. Why not label it USB 10Gbps? Amazon is sticking to the rules which say a 10Gbps isn&rsquo;t supposed to work on a 6 foot cable.</p>

<p>Also oddly, Amazon specifically claims there&rsquo;s &ldquo;no alt-mode&rdquo; support for this cable so driving a monitor won&rsquo;t work. Except it does just fine since the alt-mode on USB-C just uses the wires included for the higher-speed USB 3.1 data transfers to run the monitor. We could even drive our high-performance Thunderbolt drive at 20Gbps transfer rates so way to sell yourself short Amazon.</p>

<p>The only real disappointment with the cable is charging is limited to 3 amps which means it tops out at 60-watt charge rates. That&rsquo;s fine for a Dell XPS 13 or MacBook Pro 13, but not enough for a Dell XPS 15 or MacBook Pro 16. In fact, that&rsquo;s the primary reason we didn&rsquo;t give the cable the nod for best brand-name cable pick.</p>

<p>It does carry Amazon&rsquo;s name which has value to some, but at $19, it&rsquo;s hardly a steal. With that said, this is a fine cable, but there are indeed ones with more capability too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Compared to our picks above, we wouldn&rsquo;t advise purchasing any of the other USB-C cables we tested. Why settle for something inferior? But we understand some will want to see which cables didn&rsquo;t make the cut and why.</p>

<p>The Dockcase USB-C to USB-C cable is the worst value here if you only judge a cable by length and price. In capability though, this 8.5-inch cable is one of the better performers&mdash;a consequence of its short length. The shorter the cable, the less the resistance and, well, the better the performance, even with thin wires.</p>

<p>The Dockcase advertises a 100-watt charge rate, 4K video support, and even Thunderbolt 3 support. The company doesn&rsquo;t mention it but that Thunderbolt 3 speed is limited to 20Gbps, not the full 40Gbps Thunderbolt 3 users expect, so take note. It&rsquo;s not practical, but we did charge our laptop at 100 watts with the Dockcase.</p>

<p>Physically, the cable is a flat design with a rubbery outer sheath. The strain relief where the cable connects to the housing is minimal, as well, which makes us question its durability over time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its length is best suited for an ultra-fast portable USB-C SSD, and can pinch hit for charging or running your monitor. We personally wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it for use with a high-speed Thunderbolt drive or device though, given its aforementioned limitations with that spec.</p>

<p>The Amazon Basics USB-C to USB-C USB 2.0 is the cable that epitomizes minimum effort. At 6-feet long, it will do its job to charge your phone or tablet, and even your laptop at up to 60 watts, and that&rsquo;s about it. Since it&rsquo;s a USB 2.0 cable, data transfers to or from your computer will be dog slow compared to a USB 3.1 cable. Moving a 1GB file might take a few seconds on a USB 3.1 cable and nearly a minute with the Amazon Basics USB-C Charging cable.</p>

<p>The cable itself is amazingly light. In fact, it&rsquo;s probably too light, which means Amazon didn&rsquo;t really use the thickest wires it could for this cable. That shows up with some of the highest resistance among the cables 6 feet or longer in this roundup, meaning less power delivered to your phone or tablet. Granted, we are talking about 2 percent lower wattage compared to the best of the longer cables here. But still, that&rsquo;s like a school report card that says &ldquo;present&rdquo; as its main selling point.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not all bad for the Amazon Basics cable. It does carry a big-name brand. And its lack of wires to support higher-speed USB 3.1 makes it relatively thin and light, and very pliable.</p>

<p>Would we use this cable to charge our laptop every day? Probably not, but for someone charging a phone or tablet, its lightweight feel can be be a plus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has a black plastic sleeve without the tacky rubbery feel some cables have. On the inside it&rsquo;s about average, with actual charging performance somewhat better than the Amazon Basics USB 2.0 cable but not in the class of the Javex cable, which supports charge rates up to 100 watts instead of the Powerline&rsquo;s 60 watts.

<p>Unfortunately, while it&rsquo;s a decent cable for certain uses, its pricing hurts it. At its typical pricing of $12 it&rsquo;s not worth it.

<p>Do you get what you pay for? JSAUX &ldquo;USB C to USB C Cable&rdquo; kinda proves the old adage that says if the price is low, there&rsquo;s a reason for it. Not only do you get a 6.6-foot / 2-meter USB-C to USB-C cable in the box&mdash;you get two of them for what other brands might charge you for just one cable. Unlike some lesser-known cables on Amazon, the JSAUX cables are at least properly marketed with warnings that it is NOT a Thunderbolt 3 cable, it can NOT output video, and its charge rate is limited to 60 watts, with data limited to a very slow 480MBps. It&rsquo;s essentially a basic USB-C charging cable and not the greatest one. We looked at the internal resistance of the cable itself and found it to be pretty mediocre. In fact, we haven&rsquo;t seen a USB-C to USB-C cable with worse resistance. That pretty much means it skimps on internal wiring and potentially may not hold up over time as the cable is flexed over and over again. With all this said, most people don&rsquo;t actually need high charge rates on a charging cable (where less resistance would be more valuable) and we think that&rsquo;s reflected in the more than 31,000 reviews of this top-selling cable&mdash;with most of them positive&mdash;from around the world. </p>

<p>We&rsquo;d pass for a slightly pricier cable, and would even prefer the Amazon Basics cable to it, but we do recognize that for charging a smart phone and tablet, it&rsquo;ll probably be fine, which explains how there are 31,000 happy customers. There are, however, better choices out there for those willing to pay for it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-we-test-usb-c-cables">How we test USB-C cables</h2>



<p>For this roundup, we purchased retail USB-C cables for our testing.&nbsp;We physically measured and weighed each cable and examined each connector. A proper USB-C cable should use a one-piece shell rather than a folded shell with a visible seam in it. None of the cables we purchased used the lower-strength folded shells.</p>



<p>We do want to point out that weight does tend to matter. All cables are essentially tiny metallic wire strands bound together with insulation. Sure, the connector, housing,&nbsp; braiding, and outer shell all factors in its weight, but lighter-duty cables literally have fewer wires and are far lighter. For example, the Cable Matters high-performance USB 4 cable is 32-inches long and weighs more than the Amazon Basics low-performance USB 2.0 cable, which is more than twice as long.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s not always better though, as a cable with more wires that are a heavier gauge&mdash;or thicker&mdash;are less pliable and also take up more space in your bag.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="are-they-all-wired-correctly">Are they all wired correctly?</h3>



<p>You&rsquo;d think you could tell whether a cable is USB-C 2.0 cable by looking at the wires in the connector but that&rsquo;s not the case. Some cables use connectors with pins that aren&rsquo;t hooked up to anything.</p>



<p>To check each cable, we&nbsp;use a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.tindie.com/products/BitTradeOne/usb-cable-checker-2-assembled/&amp;xcust=2-1-395115-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BitTradeOne USB Cable Checker 2.0</a> to first see what actual wires are inside of the cable and whether they are hooked up correctly and what they do. For example, a USB-C cable that is fine for charging but a dog in data transfer&nbsp; &nbsp;will show up as being wired only for USB-C 2.0, as you can see below by the green LEDs. The &ldquo;CC&rdquo; LED indicates the Cable Configuration channel is wired up correctly.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/09/usb_c_2.0-100901753-orig.jpg?auto=webp" rel="nofollow"><img alt="usb c 2.0" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/09/usb_c_2.0-100901753-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">
<p>The basic Amazon Basics USB-C cable is wired only for USB 2.0 data rates.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>A full-featured USB-C cable has additional wires to carry higher-speed data and the USB Cable Checker 2.0 shows this Cable Matters USB 4 cable in the picture below with the correct wiring all available. The small LED display also tells us that the cable has an ID e-Marker chip, the shell is properly grounded to the cable, and it does a quick resistance test too.&nbsp;The cable tester also checks to see if the metal shell of the cable is grounded to the ground wire of the cable, which is required by spec. Every cable here was properly grounded.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="resistance-is-futile">Resistance is futile</h3>



<p>The resistance check from our cable checker is quick and dirty, so we augmented that by also measuring the resistance of the cable&rsquo;s ground wire and vbus wire using a milli-ohm meter connected via a pair of USB-C breakout boards. The breakout boards at both ends add about 30 mohms to the total. By spec, a USB-C cable should not exceed 83 mohms on the ground wires and 167 mohms on the voltage bus.</p>



<p>Many of the cables we tested were within spec or close enough that it didn&rsquo;t matter, since there&rsquo;s likely even more resistance we&rsquo;re not able to account for with our method. We definitely could tell which cables used heavier-gauge or thick wires with less resistance to restrict the flow of electricity, and which ones cheaped out.</p>

</figcaption></figure></div>




<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-did-the-e-marker-say">What did the e-Marker say?</h3>



<p>Since each of the more advanced cables carries an e-Marker that tells the computer what the cable can do, we noted that and the validity of the e-Marker&rsquo;s claims. All but one of the cables met those claims, but the one that was wrong was way, way wrong. It claimed USB 3.2 10Gbps transfer speeds and a 1-meter length, when it literally didn&rsquo;t have the wires for the faster transfer speeds and was actually 2 meters long.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/09/emarker-100901754-orig.jpg?auto=webp" rel="nofollow"><img alt="emarker" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/09/emarker-100901754-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">
<p>Some USB-C cables feature a chip or e-Marker that contains information the device reads. This two meter cable&rsquo;s e-Marker is incorrect.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>We then looked at how fast the cable would charge and transfer data, and whether it supported an alternate mode to run a monitor, using real-world hardware.</p>



<p>For charging speeds we recorded the maximum wattage at which the cable could charge an Asus ROG Strix 15 gaming laptop over its USB-C port using USB-Power Delivery with an Aukey 100 watt USB-PD charger as the source while the laptop was under load.&nbsp;USB-PD today is limited to 100 watts (with a 240-watt spec on the way). Any USB-C to USB-C cable should handle 3 amps&nbsp;at 20 volts, or 60 watts.&nbsp;All of the USB-C to USB-C cables fell into the standard 60-watt or 100-watt camps.</p>



<p>We didn&rsquo;t test the temperature of each cable&rsquo;s housing, but we did test the cheapest cable by running it at 5 amps and 20 volts for an hour. The housing heated up by 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and the cable itself became relatively warm (see the thermal image below). Not ideal, but it did this without failure. We subjected other cables to two-hour loads without failure, as well.</p>



<p>For one final charge test, we tasked each cable with a 20 volt, 3 amp and 20 volt 5 amp load (for the 5-amp rated cables) and measured the voltage delivered at the end of the cable using our CT-3 meter.</p>



<p>The cables with the thinnest-gauge wires add more resistance, which in turn reduces the voltage delivered to your laptop, tablet, or phone.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/09/thermal_usb_c-100901756-orig.jpg?auto=webp" rel="nofollow"><img alt="thermal usb c" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/09/thermal_usb_c-100901756-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">
<p>The thinner the wires used in a cable, the greater the resistance, and the greater the heat as you can see from this thermal image of a $5 6.6-foot USB cable carrying a 5 amp, 20 volt, 100-watt load for one hour.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>For data transfer, we measured the speed using Crystal Disk Mark 8 while plugged into the USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 port of an MSI Prestige 14 Evo laptop. Since the cables can also be used to transfer data from a Thunderbolt storage drive, we measured how fast that happened using a high-speed SSD-based SanDisk Professional Thunderbolt G-Drive. We found three transfer modes among the cables tested: Thunderbolt 20Gbps performance, Thunderbolt 40Gbps performance, or zero performance because the cable would not work at all with a Thunderbolt drive.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/06/1-100893464-orig.jpg?auto=webp" rel="nofollow"><img alt="1" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/06/1-100893464-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">
<p>Basic USB-C charging cables will not enable advanced drives such as this G-Drive Thunderbolt 3-based SSD, despite the USB-C plug fitting.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>Our last test looked at each cable&rsquo;s capability running an Asus ROG Strix 17.3-inch portable gaming monitor. The monitor is a high-performance gaming monitor with a resolution of 1920&times;1080 and refresh rate of 240Hz&mdash;which is basically the same bandwidth requirements of a standard 4K 60Hz display.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>There are a number of different types of USB-C to USB-C cables including: USB 2.0, USB 3.1 Gen 1, USB 3.1 Gen 2, and Thunderbolt 4.</p>



<p>The main difference between all of these is their data transfer rates and their charge rates. Basic charge cables give you very slow data transfer speeds and typically only up to 60 watts. For a phone, tablet, and even most small laptops such as a Dell XPS 13 or MacBook Pro 13 that&rsquo;s fine. As you move up to larger laptops such as a Dell XPS 15 or MacBook Pro 16, 60 watts will limit how fast you can charge. </p>



<p>The other key differentiator is speed. USB 2.0 is a plodding 480Mbps. USB 3 cables range from 5Gbps to 20Gbps. While USB4, and Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4 can support up to 40Gbps of throughput.</p>



<p>Thunderbolt, USB4, and many USB 3 cables also support display support using DisplayPort.</p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>USB-C cables today are used for transferring data, running monitors, and charging everything on the planet from $5 LED trinkets to $2,000 laptops and even power tools now. It is basically the most common type of cable for electronics today and thanks to its universal and open design it has rapidly replaced all other competitors including Apple&rsquo;s Lightning as well as older USB cables. It&rsquo;s appeal is the reversible nature so you no longer have to look for alignment. With its ability to handle 240 watts now, USB-C to USB-C cables will likely begin replacing other proprietary cables as well. </p>

<div class="wp-block-idg-base-theme-faq-answer-block how-to-tip">
<p>There are a few key differences between the two. A USB-C to USB-A cable has a rectangular connector on side with 4- to 9-pins in it. As you know from trying to plug a mouse into your PC, it only fits in one way and you usually never get it right the first time. On the other end of a USB-C to USB-A cable, you will find the modern oval USB-C connector, which fits in both ways and packs far more pins and wires inside. The short story is that a Type A to Type C cable will typically charge at much slower speeds than a Type C to Type C cable as well as transfer data at far lower data rates. That isn&rsquo;t always the case as some phones that use special Type A to Type C chargers and cables will indeed charge very fast&mdash;but they&rsquo;re usually proprietary. With most new phone chargers going to USB Type C, you&rsquo;re probably going to usually want a Type C to Type C cable.</p>

<p>Smartphone plans are expensive&mdash;but they don&rsquo;t have to be. While they&rsquo;re not nearly as astronomical as when they first launched, signing up for a plan with one of the major carriers still costs around $60 per month (before taxes!) for a single line.</p>



<p>Sure, you can sign up for a family plan to cut costs, but those generally default to an unlimited plan, which you might not need. Or you don&rsquo;t have enough people to form a big enough family (&ldquo;family&rdquo;) to see substantial savings. Good news is that there&rsquo;s another way to save major cash, and it&rsquo;s the route I took years ago&mdash;prepaid cell phone plans.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="enter-mobile-virtual-network-operators">Enter Mobile Virtual Network Operators</h2>



<p>For a long while, prepaid plans were kind of terrible. You typically put down a certain amount of money, then paid a fixed amount for every minute of calling, each text message sent or received, and each kilobyte (yes, kilobyte) of data used. Rates were generally pretty bad, too&mdash;like 25 cents per minute or text.</p>



<p>But slowly, mobile virtual network operators (MVNO) gained in the U.S. These companies lease the right to use the big carrier&rsquo;s networks, and then entice customers with a bigger and cheaper variety of smartphone plans. You want an unlimited plan, but for less? Lots of options for that. Prefer to skate by with a much slimmer bucket of minutes, text, and data? Also a route you can take.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2028657" height="498" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-4.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cricket Wireless started as a MVNO, then was purchased by AT&amp;T and made into a subsidiary of the company.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>You can find more than one MVNO for every network&mdash;so if you get your best reception through AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, or Verizon, you don&rsquo;t truly need to leave. And each MVNO has its own agreement with the network operator, so ones with better terms may offer customers a better network experience.</p>



<p>But we&rsquo;ll dig into those particulars more in a little bit. First, let&rsquo;s cover the numbers. (Also known as what everyone usually asks me about.)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-i-slashed-my-cellphone-bill-by-75-percent">How I slashed my cellphone bill by 75 percent</h2>



<p>My first cell phone plan cost me about $65 per month, inclusive of taxes, after an employee discount on the family plan I was part of. I had a set pool of talk minutes, texts, and fairly limited data.</p>



<p>Eventually I discovered a special T-Mobile prepaid plan (which no longer exists). For $30 per month, I got 100 talk minutes, unlimited text (!), and 5GB of high-speed data. Given how little I talked on the phone, it was <em>perfect</em>. The sweetest part was that cost was all-inclusive: no additional taxes. I dropped my bill by over 50 percent, and I also never again worried about unexpected overage charges. With prepaid, you pay upfront. If you run through your allotted minutes, text, or data, you have to top up with more (for reasonable prices). Otherwise, it stops working.</p>



<p>When my calling started to increase, I switched to a MVNO that had a plan with similar data but more minutes. It offered a sizable discount for prepaying a whole year upfront. My cost dropped again to a little under $15 per month.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2028669" height="462" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-5.png?w=1200" width="818" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A few MVNOs offer even deeper savings through special eBay storefronts. Be sure of the network conditions before committing to these year-long plans, though. </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As someone who is going it solo with her cell phone plan, this is a huge win. If I were still part of a family plan, I could probably get an unlimited plan for around $30 per month, all-inclusive. But that&rsquo;s additional logistical headache, plus I don&rsquo;t need that. I&rsquo;m happy to save the extra $180 per year.</p>



<p>The fun part is that if your usage is even lighter than mine, you can still find a right-sized plan for you. Two of my older relatives? For the longest time, they paid $8 per month through Red Pocket because their data usage was so low. I have yet another that I hooked up with a (now sadly more expensive) Tracfone plan that offered 1200 talk, text, and megabytes of data for a whole year. Total cost? $30 on sale (formerly $60 regular price).</p>


<p class="cta wp-block wp-block-button"><a class="cta__btn" href="https://mint-mobile.58dp.net/c/321564/444520/7915?subId1=2-1-2028646-7-0-0&amp;u=https://www.mintmobile.com/&amp;partnerpropertyid=322172" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Get Mint Mobile cell plans for $15/mo.</a></p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-caveats">The caveats</h2>



<p>We cover these points in more depth in our article on the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/431600/cheapest-cell-phone-plans.html">best cheap cell phone plans</a>, but prepaid cell phones require a little more research to ensure you get a good experience.</p>



<p>First, there are tons of prepaid plans, and not all of them are priced competitively. Weigh pricing and perks carefully, and be ready to wade into the fine print. An &ldquo;unlimited&rdquo; plan with one MVNO may throttle your data speeds much sooner than another MVNO, for example. Or your video stream quality may be capped at much lower resolutions.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2028685" height="223" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-6.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Pay attention to the fine print, especially if you&rsquo;re interested in unlimited data plans. There&rsquo;s almost always a threshold that triggers speed reductions.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>You should also find out what other people say about the reception in your area. Because even if, say, T-Mobile is your best bet among the post-paid carriers in your area, not all T-Mobile MVNOs perform just as well. There&rsquo;s a hierarchy when a phone connects to a cell tower, and prepaid plan subscribers don&rsquo;t all fall in the same tier. Naturally, they all come behind postpaid customers, who get first priority when calling, texting, or using data. But for some networks, a subsidiary of the company (e.g., AT&amp;T&rsquo;s Cricket Wireless) and/or one of their own prepaid plans will be further ahead in line than an MVNO.</p>



<p>(Speaking of: The only times I really notice a difference in reception quality with my current plan is in locations with extremely high congestion, like a densely packed stadium or trade show. But it&rsquo;s usually not an issue.)</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-2028724" height="651" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-7.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Forums may seem a little antiquated in 2023,  but the information in HowardForums about prepaid carriers (and all things mobile) is hard to beat.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>You can find all this information online (sites like Reddit and HowardForums are especially helpful), but it takes a little digging around. Skipping this research can lead to a bad experience with a prepaid plan, since every area has different reception per network and different levels of saturation (number of customers on the network). If you&rsquo;re lucky, you&rsquo;ll have several strong options for MVNO and direct prepaid plans for where you live, work, and travel.</p>

## Quake II gets an enhanced port 26 years after release

<p>If you&rsquo;re old enough to remember when the term &ldquo;DOOM clone&rdquo; was something you&rsquo;d see in a magazine (printed on paper, made out of dead trees!), then you probably have fond memories of the early days of first-person shooters. <em>Quake II</em> is a landmark in the genre, building on the grungy aesthetic of the original with a more sci-fi feel and more multiplayer options. Now the <em>Quake </em>franchise owner Bethesda has released an enhanced omnibus version of the game, complete with tech enhancements, all the original expansion packs, and even new missions. </p>



<p><em>Quake II</em> followed on the story of the original game with an 18-level initial campaign (which will probably feel a little barebones if you&rsquo;ve ever played anything post-<em>Half-Life</em>), plus another 15 levels in the Ground Zero add-on. The brand new content in the updated version includes a whopping 28 new single-player levels facing off against the nightmarish Strogg, plus a new multiplayer map to add to the 20+ maps from the original. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The updated version of <em>Quake II</em> brings back multiplayer in both 16-player online deathmatches and local play with 4-player split-screen (or 8 players across two screens, for the PC version). The new version of the game enables cross-play between PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch versions&hellip;though PC players will have to handicap themselves with a controller if they want to face off against consoles. </p>



<p>Updated visuals allow <em>Quake II</em> to be played in 4K and with widescreen support, plus some gently enhanced 3D models and animations, better lighting, anti-aliasing, and a grab-bag of other enhancements and accessibility options from the last two decades. The best feature of all might be the price. Bethesda&rsquo;s asking an entirely reasonable $10 for this re-release &mdash; <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/take-two-ceo-says-50-for-red-dead-redemption-on-switch-and-ps4-is-commercially-accurate/&amp;xcust=2-1-2029127-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rockstar and Nintendo</a> could take notes. </p>

## Robots soundly beat humans in bot-spotting captcha tests

<p>If you&rsquo;ve surfed the web, you&rsquo;ve no doubt run into captcha test &mdash; those annoying &ldquo;fill in all the boxes with cars&rdquo; challenges presented when you want to sign up to an email list, log in somewhere, or whatever.</p>



<p>Websites use captchas to protect online systems and forms from automated robots that crawl sites daily for various purposes. But a new study from the University of California shows that today&rsquo;s robots are actually better and faster at solving captcha challenges than humans. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/captcha-test-bots-better-humans-b2389998.html&amp;xcust=2-1-2029241-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Independent</a> reports that the study was conducted on over 100 different sites, all using some form of captcha robot protection. 1,000 people were asked to do 10 captcha tests and were then crushed by the different bots in terms of both time and accuracy. The humans had a 50-85 percent accuracy rate while the bots boasted 85-100 percent.</p>



<p>It is important to point out that the study has not undergone a so-called &ldquo;peer review&rdquo; yet and only exists in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12108&amp;xcust=2-1-2029241-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Arxiv </a>&mdash; a platform for digital pre-publication of scientific reports.</p>



<p>Since defeating robots but allowing humans access to sites is the entire point of captcha systems, it will be interesting to see how robot protection develop in the future. Hopefully they&rsquo;ll cause less headaches for us humans in a few years. </p>

<p>When it comes to pairing speakers with your PC, you actually have a lot of choice. You&rsquo;re not limited only to models marketed for that purpose&mdash;you can also cross over into Bluetooth speakers (for a cleaner desk setup) or bookshelf speakers (if you&rsquo;re more of an audiophile).</p>



<p>But there&rsquo;s something to be said about computer speakers, with their combination of smaller footprint and more powerful output. Case in point: The Edifier G2000, a set of multi-device speakers that leans hard into a gamer vibe.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="edifier-g200-design-and-features">Edifier G200 design and features</h2>



<p>At $110, the G2000 may seem like a hard sell compared to the more powerful and marginally more expensive $120 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/546032/edifier-r1280t-review-these-attractive-speakers-deliver-solid-performance.html">Edifier R1280T</a>, which gives more direct control over treble and bass, and also gets quite loud. But these 32W desktop speakers blend into a computer setup more easily, measuring just 4.17 x 4.13 x 5.11 inches (106 x 105 x 130mm)&mdash;they tuck neatly under a monitor. You can also connect multiple devices to them, with USB, 3.5mm aux, and Bluetooth 5.1 all supported. And as part of the gaming vibe, they naturally have RGB lights, too.

<p>A non-detachable wire connects the two speakers, with the controls located on the side of the right one. There&rsquo;s a button that swaps the connection mode if you press it, and also powers down the speakers if you long-press instead. Below it is a rocker switch for volume&mdash;which looks quite slick, but in practice is a little annoying. (You need your whole hand in order to crank the volume up, whereas a volume dial would&rsquo;ve been far easier for one-handed adjustments.) Underneath the volume rocker is another button that controls the EQ settings between Movie, Music, or Gaming presets if you press it, and the RGB lighting color if you long-press.</p>



<p>The right speaker also houses all the physical connectors. In addition to the wire connecting it to the left speaker, there&rsquo;s a USB port, two jacks for 3.5mm aux and connection to a subwoofer, and the power port. You&rsquo;ll need an available wall outlet for the G2000, by the way&mdash;they run off of AC power, rather than a USB connection.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>If you want tidy, sleek-looking speakers with decent audio and a gamer vibe, the G2000 fills that niche well while also supporting other devices.</p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Edifier G2000 physical controls" class="wp-image-2024550" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/side-shot-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The physical controls for the  G2000 are all located on the right speaker.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Alaina Yee / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Clarity on these speakers is sharp, with just a moderate amount of bass. I personally found mid-range and high frequencies so crisp that they bordered on having a harsh edge, but others may like this brightness. Moving between the different preset EQ settings doesn&rsquo;t change this sound profile, either&mdash;instead, what gets emphasized in the mix changes. Music mode makes vocals more prominent without minimizing the bass, while gaming mode pushes mid-range sounds (e.g., voices and audio cues) to the foreground. Real talk, though: If you&rsquo;re serious about your gaming, you&rsquo;ll own headphones anyway, especially since the audio sounds even a little more hollow in this mode. For its part, movie mode is the most balanced.</p>



<p>But regardless of what EQ mode you&rsquo;re in, you can push these speakers pretty loud&mdash;enough to easily fill a bedroom or office. I usually kept the volume percentage around the high 20s to mid 30s in Windows for light listening in a quiet environment, which left plenty of room to crank it up.</p>

<p>Microsoft just delivered <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/08/10/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-23521/&amp;xcust=2-1-2029121-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Windows 11 Build 23521</a> to insiders in the Dev Channel. The most interesting new feature is the support for Windows 365 Switch, which will also be available for Windows 11 test versions in the beta channel. You can switch with a keystroke, swipe gesture or mouse click.</p>



<p>Microsoft describes the new Windows 365 Switch feature in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/windows-365-switch-now-available-in-public-preview/ba-p/3891857&amp;xcust=2-1-2029121-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&ldquo;Windows 365 Switch provides the ability to easily move between a Windows 365 Cloud PC and the local desktop using the same familiar keyboard commands, as well as a mouse-click or a swipe gesture. Windows 365 Switch enables a seamless experience from within Windows 11 via the Task view feature.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Microsoft continues:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&ldquo;This new round tripping feature is extremely valuable for bring-your-own device (BYOD) scenarios when you connect from your own Windows device to a secure company owned Cloud PC.&rdquo; </p>
</blockquote>



<p>In other words, you can switch from a PC or notebook with Windows 11 to a completely separate Windows installation in the cloud and back again at any time. This makes sense, for example, if you also want to work professionally on your private computer and all data and files should be strictly separated from each other in order to comply with data protection regulations or security requirements.</p>

<p>These are the current requirements for using the Windows 365 switch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Windows 11-based endpoints (available in Windows 11 Pro and Enterprise)</li>



<li>Participation in the Windows Insider Program (Beta Channel preferred, but Dev Channel also supported) <strong>for both Windows 11 and Windows 365</strong></li>

<p>Is your computer&rsquo;s CPU too hot? If your PC starts spontaneously shutting down, locking up, or acting sluggish during intense tasks, overheating could be the issue, especially when the intense summer heat is scorching. Keeping tabs on your CPU temperatures is crucial when you&rsquo;re <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3186812/computers/how-to-overclock-your-pcs-cpu.html">overclocking your PC&rsquo;s processor</a>, too&mdash;you don&rsquo;t want to accidentally push the performance pedal <em>too far</em> to the metal when you&rsquo;re supercharging your pricey <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1470602/intel-to-crack-6ghz-barrier-with-699-core-i9.html">6GHz Intel Core i9-13900KS</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1524570/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d-review-v-cache.html">AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D</a>, after all. Melting one of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/401980/best-cpus-for-gaming.html">the best CPUs</a> around is always a bummer.</p>



<p>Bizarrely, Windows doesn&rsquo;t offer any way to check your computer&rsquo;s CPU temperature. You could dive into your system&rsquo;s BIOS to find the information, but that&rsquo;s a lot of hassle to find a simple sensor reading. Fortunately, several free programs exist that make it easy to see your processor&rsquo;s temperature. With that info in hand, you&rsquo;ll know whether you&rsquo;ll need to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394965/how-to-set-up-your-pcs-fans-for-maximum-system-cooling.html">take more active steps</a> to cool things down. We&rsquo;ve included information on how to do that after the software recommendations below.</p>



<p>But first, make sure your fans and grills are clean of dust and debris, which can significantly impede with your system&rsquo;s cooling. Every PC owner should have a supply of canned air around for this purpose.</p>

<p>Once installed, open Core Temp to see a no-frills look at the current state of your CPU, including an average temperature reading at the bottom of the window. If you want even more detail, click the <em>Show hidden icons</em> button in the system tray located at the right edge of your Windows taskbar. You&rsquo;ll see a temperature listing for every individual CPU core in your computer.</p>

<p>Core Temp&rsquo;s Settings menu allows you to tweak exactly what you&rsquo;ll see in the system tray, and how you&rsquo;ll see it, but the default configuration makes it dead-simple to see if your CPU is overheating or performing as expected.</p>



<p>Core Temp isn&rsquo;t the only option though. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.hwinfo.com/&amp;xcust=2-3-407914-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">HWInfo</a> is an in-depth system monitoring tool that provides deep details about every piece of your PC&rsquo;s hardware.

<p>Finally, note that if you&rsquo;re running an AMD Ryzen system, including current models like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1074246/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-review.html">ferocious Ryzen 9 7950X</a>&nbsp;or the more modest Ryzen 5 7600X, you may see two different CPU temperature readings. You want the &ldquo;Tdie&rdquo; reading, depending on how the program you&rsquo;re using displays the info. It&rsquo;s a measurement of the actual heat on the die.</p>



<p>The alternative &ldquo;Tctl&rdquo; reading is the control temperature reported to your cooling system and sometimes includes a temperature offset to ensure universal fan speed behavior between the various Ryzen chips. Any of the programs above that list a single temperature account for the offset already.</p>

<p>The maximum supported temperature varies from processor to processor. Most of the free monitoring software mentioned above lists the information as &ldquo;Tj. Max.&rdquo; That stands for the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junction_temperature&amp;xcust=2-3-407914-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">temperature junction</a>, or the highest operating temperature of the hardware. If you don&rsquo;t see the information for some reason, search the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://www.cpu-world.com/index.html&amp;xcust=2-3-407914-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">CPU World website</a> for your CPU&rsquo;s model number to find the information. Every program listed above displays your processor&rsquo;s model number, so it&rsquo;s easy to find.</p>



<p>But that&rsquo;s the <em>maximum</em> temperature&mdash;the point at which your processor freaks out and shuts down to avoid damage. Running anywhere near that hot regularly is bad for the long-term life of your hardware. Instead, follow this general rule of thumb regarding CPU temperatures under load. &nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Under 60&deg; C</strong>: You&rsquo;re running great!</li>



<li><strong>60&deg; C to 70&deg; C</strong>: Still running fine, but getting a bit warmer. Consider cleaning the dust out of your PC if CPU temperatures continue to creep up over time.</li>



<li><strong>70&deg; C to 80&deg; C</strong>: This is hotter than you want to run unless you&rsquo;re pushing an overclock. If you&rsquo;re not, definitely check to make sure your fans are working and there aren&rsquo;t dust bunnies clogging up your system&rsquo;s airflow.</li>



<li><strong>80&deg; C to 90&deg; C</strong>: Now we&rsquo;re getting too hot for long-term comfort. Check your hardware for broken fans or dust build-up, and if you&rsquo;re overclocking, dial back your settings&mdash;especially the voltage if you&rsquo;ve tweaked it. One notable exception: We sometimes see more powerful laptop processors hit the low 80s during gaming sessions when plugged in, at which point they start throttling back performance. This is expected, but if temperatures cross 85&deg; C, be concerned.</li>



<li><strong>Over 90&deg; C</strong>: Danger, Will Robinson!</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-lower-your-cpu-temperatures">How to lower your CPU temperatures</h2>



<p>If you&rsquo;re regularly encountering high CPU temperatures, there are some steps you can take to try and fix the issue.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="clean pc" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/02/clean-pc-100748691-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">
<p>Roll up your sleeves.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>First, clean out your PC. High CPU temperatures are often caused by years of dust and grime built up inside a PC, clogging fans and crucial air pathways. Local hardware stores usually charge outrageous prices for canned air, but you can pick up a bottle for about <a class="product-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B0000AE67M&amp;xcust=2-3-407914-1-392360-16799&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">$8 on Amazon</a>. PCWorld&rsquo;s guide on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2037100/youre-a-dirty-dirty-dusty-pc.html">how to clean your PC</a> can walk you through the process. While you&rsquo;re at it, check to make sure that all your fans are working correctly,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3619063/how-to-tell-which-way-your-fan-is-blowing.html">pointed the right way</a>, and that none of the vents in your PC are blocked.&nbsp;(Also, make sure&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3628172/how-to-set-up-your-pcs-fans-for-maximum-system-cooling.html">your PC&rsquo;s fans are set up for maximum cooling performance</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hopefully that fixes the issue. If not, more intensive steps are in order. The thermal paste that transfers heat from your CPU to its cooler might have dried out if you&rsquo;ve had your PC for a few years. That can cause temperature spikes.</p>



<p>Removing the old thermal paste with rubbing alcohol and applying a fresh layer can potentially help lower temperatures by a large amount. You can find small syringes of thermal paste by respected brands like Arctic&nbsp;and <a class="product-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B002CQU14A&amp;xcust=2-3-407914-1-391479-16311&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Noctua</a>&nbsp;for under $10 on Amazon.

<p>If all <em>that</em> doesn&rsquo;t help, your cooling solution simply might not be capable of keeping up with your CPU&rsquo;s heat output, especially if you&rsquo;re pairing a stock cooler or a modest third-party cooler with higher-end chips&mdash;and doubly so if you&rsquo;re overclocking. Buying a new CPU cooler may be in order.</p>

<p>Closed-loop liquid cooling solutions (CLCs) provide far cooler temperatures than air coolers with minimal hassle and easy installation. Smaller 120mm units are available, but if you plan on overclocking, consider moving up to a model with&nbsp;larger 240mm radiator.&nbsp;We&rsquo;re also partial to the even larger 280mm NZXT Kraken X63 ($150 on <a class="product-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B082DYR132&amp;xcust=2-3-407914-1-392776-14418&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon</a>).

## Make Windows search so much better with these tricks

<p>If you only ever use the Windows search function to track down the occasional program or settings menu, you&rsquo;d be forgiven.</p>



<p>In the past, Windows search was notoriously slow at tracking down files, and in recent years the search panel has become more bloated with things like Bing search results. As such, the Windows search bar might not be your first stop when looking for files or information.</p>



<p>But with the right tweaks&mdash;and, perhaps, an extra app or two&mdash;you can turn Windows in to a powerful search solution, not just for your own files, but for quick answers, web searches, and your online documents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-search-basics">Windows search basics</h2>

<p>First, an oft-overlooked tip on searching in Windows: The actual search bar is completely superfluous. Just press the Windows key or click the Windows Start menu button, then begin typing to bring up search results&mdash;no separate search button required.</p>



<p>That, in turn, means you can hide the Windows search bar to free up some taskbar space. Right-click the taskbar, select Taskbar Settings, then select &ldquo;Hide&rdquo; in the Search drop-down menu at the top.</p>



<p>You should also make sure Windows search is finding all your files. From the Start menu, type &ldquo;Indexing,&rdquo; then open the &ldquo;Indexing Options&rdquo; menu. From here you can click the &ldquo;Modify&rdquo; button to choose the folders whose contents should appear in search results.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="find-info-from-windows-search">Find info from Windows Search</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Weather results in Windows search" class="wp-image-2014140" height="882" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/windowssearchweather.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Windows Search can be more than just a place to find files, programs, and settings. It can also provide quick answers to common queries. For example:</p>



<ul>
<li>Type &ldquo;Weather&rdquo; and a location to see the forecast.</li>



<li>Type a word along with &ldquo;Definition,&rdquo; &ldquo;Synonym,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Antonym.&rdquo;</li>



<li>Enter a math equation to get the solution.</li>



<li>Ask to convert currencies or units of measurement.</li>



<li>Type &ldquo;[phrase] in [language]&rdquo; for a quick translation.</li>



<li>Type a flight number to check status.</li>



<li>Get answers to basic queries, like &ldquo;Population of NYC.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>



<p>These are essentially the same instant answers you&rsquo;d get at the top of a results page in Bing. Only in this case, you needn&rsquo;t open a browser tab to see them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="changing-the-default-search-engine">Changing the default search engine</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="MSEdgeRedirect: Changing Bing results to DuckDuckGo" class="wp-image-2014141" height="633" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/msedgeredirectoptions.png" width="802" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>You can also use Windows search to look up things on the web, but there&rsquo;s one problem: Web searches always flow through Microsoft&rsquo;s Edge browser and Bing.</p>



<p>While there&rsquo;s no official way to change these settings, you can install <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://github.com/rcmaehl/MSEdgeRedirect&amp;xcust=2-1-2014130-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">MSEdgeRedirect</a> to use your default browser and preferred search engine instead.</p>



<p>During installation, make sure to select &ldquo;Active Mode,&rdquo; which will improve the app&rsquo;s performance. On the next screen, use the &ldquo;Additional Redirections&rdquo; setting to choose your search engine for web searches.</p>



<p>Now, press the Windows key and type in a web search query. Windows will continue to use Bing for its live previews in the search box, but pressing Enter will load the search in your default browser, with whatever search engine you chose above.</p>



<p>You can always revisit your redirect settings through the &ldquo;MSER Settings&rdquo; app via the Start menu.</p>

Press&nbsp;<strong>Alt+Space</strong>, and it&rsquo;ll launch a search box in the middle of the screen.</p>



<p>In some ways, PowerToys Run is less capable than Windows&rsquo; built-in search function. It can&rsquo;t provide instant answers to basic questions, and it lacks filters to show only documents or apps.</p>



<p>But it&rsquo;s also more customizable, and supports geekier functions such as executing shell commands. Much of this customization appears inside the PowerToys Settings app, where you can toggle various plugins and prioritize them in search results.</p>



<p>Also: If you enable the web search plugin in PowerToys Run, it&rsquo;ll open in your default browser and search engine with no extra software required.</p>

<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows search tools still have one big blind spot: You can&rsquo;t use them to search through online services such as Notion, Slack, or Google Drive.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s where&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://slapdash.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-2014130-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Slapdash</a> comes in. This free app lets you connect all kinds of online services, then search through them by pressing <strong>Ctrl+J</strong>. It&rsquo;s great for looking for recent Slack conversation, loading pages in Notion, or tracking down a Google Sheet. (You can connect five of these apps for free, or more with a $12 per month subscription.)</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Slapdash can&rsquo;t search local Windows files, so you can&rsquo;t use it as a full replacement for Windows search or PowerToys Run. Still, its ability to search across web apps and services makes it a great complement to Microsoft&rsquo;s own search tools.</p>

<p>Budget gaming rigs are getting gloriously close to their premium counterparts in terms of their hardware offerings &ndash; just like budget smartphones have done for a while now. Quite frankly I love it &ndash; it simply means you can get a gaming rig with very decent specs, and from a $3,000 budget, keep close to $2,000 in the bank.</p>



<p>The Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 is just such a laptop. No, it hasn&rsquo;t been chiseled from a single block of aluminum and it doesn&rsquo;t sound like a precision-tuned futuristic boom box, but to me that doesn&rsquo;t matter much. It&rsquo;s still powerful enough to produce decent frame rates in AAA games, is exceptionally stylish and has I/O options galore. Plus, you can pick it up for a steal. Read on to discover this gaming laptop&rsquo;s best features.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="acer-predator-helios-price-and-specs">Acer Predator Helios: Price and specs</h3>



<p>Looking at the configurations for this laptop and right now, the base model Helios Neo 16 featuring an Intel Core i5-13500HX and GeForce RTX 4050 GPU with WUXGA (165Hz) display costs just $1,199.99. For the top-of-the-line model, however, you can expect to pay $2,799.99 for a laptop featuring an Intel Core i9-13900HX with GeForce RTX 4080 GPU and higher resolution WQXGA (240Hz) display.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&ldquo;All that space has allowed Acer to squeeze in full-sized arrow keys, a numpad, media keys and even a few useful hotkeys &ndash; one of which lets you access Acer&rsquo;s PredatorSense utility app with a Just single press</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Comparing our Helios Neo 16 review unit to laptops in the same budget category, and you can currently buy the Lenovo Legion 5i with an Intel i5-13500HX and RTX 4050 GPU with a higher resolution WQXGA (165Hz) display for $1179.99, that&rsquo;s $20 less than the most affordable Helios Neo 16.</p>



<p>Up against MSI&rsquo;s range of budget gaming laptops Acer&rsquo;s $1,199.99 base model Helios Neo 16 is quite competitively priced. For example, the cheapest 2023 MSI gaming laptop we can currently find in stock online is the MSI Stealth 14 for $1299.99 at Best Buy. This laptop features a Core i5-13620H CPU and RTX 4060 GPU and sports a smaller 14-inch display. Here, I broke down my review unit&rsquo;s specification as follows.</p>



<ul>
<li>CPU: Intel Core i7-13700HX</li>



<li>RAM: 16GB DDR5 / 4800MHz</li>



<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060</li>



<li>Display: 16-inch WUXGA (1920 x 1200p), 165Hz refresh rate, IPS-level</li>



<li>Storage: 512GB PCIe Gen 4 SSD</li>



<li>Ports: 2 x Thunderbolt 4, 3 x USB-A 3.2, HDMI 2.1, Micro SD card slot, Ethernet port, 3.5 mm combo jack, Kensington lock</li>



<li>Networking: Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2</li>



<li>Weight: 5.73 lbs (2.6kg)</li>



<li>Dimensions: 14.18 x 11.02 x 1.11 inches</li>



<li>Battery: 90Whr</li>



<li>Price: Start at $1,199.99</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="acer-predator-helios-neo-16-design-and-build">Acer Predator Helios Neo 16: Design and build</h3>



<p>The Neo 16 is designed to give you all the functionality you&rsquo;d expect in a much more expensive laptop but without the steep price tag. That said, the trade-off is you do get a chassis with more plastic than you&rsquo;ll find in some laptops. It&rsquo;s mainly concentrated on the underside, though, which is some consolation. In fact, the base of the chassis and upper most part of the lid both have a good dollop of metal, so your main contact points are robust enough for heavy use.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Helios Neo 16" class="wp-image-2022963" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>The Helios Neo 16&rsquo;s subtle gamer-centric styling adds to its appeal.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>The design is quite gamer centric. The laptop&rsquo;s matte black finish has almost a dark blue sheen to it. The lid features an Acer Predator logo, as well as a code-like scramble of numbers for styling. Vents and grooves sit along the flanks and underside, giving it a kind of futuristic feel. While there&rsquo;s no RGB light bar to speak of, the laptop&rsquo;s angular lines and tall display make it appear pricier than it is; indeed, if you&rsquo;re hunting for a budget gaming rig, you&rsquo;d be none the wiser that it costs approximately $1,000.</p>



<p>From a size perspective, the Neo 16 is one of the larger 16-inch gaming laptops I&rsquo;ve seen this year. It measures 14.18 x 1.11 x 11.02 inches which is longer, wider and thicker than options like the Asus ROG Strix G16 and Razer Blade 16. That simply means it needs more table space to sit on. At 5.73 lbs it&rsquo;s only about 3.2 ounces heavier though, so won&rsquo;t cause any noticeable difference in portability.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="acer-predator-helios-neo-16-keyboard-and-trackpad">Acer Predator Helios Neo 16: Keyboard and trackpad</h3>



<p>The Neo 16&rsquo;s keyboard is an all-round winner, being large, flashy, and boasting a very generous key layout. It stretches the whole width of the base leaving only a fingernail&rsquo;s width on either side. All that space has allowed Acer to squeeze in full-sized arrow keys, a numpad, media keys and even a few useful hotkeys &ndash; one of which lets you access Acer&rsquo;s PredatorSense utility app with a Just single press.</p>



<p>I was impressed by the colorful four zone RGB backlighting, which in default mode flashed intermittently like a Fourth of July fireworks display. The keys themselves felt nice and springy. Acer has made certain keys transparent around their periphery which accentuates the RGB. This transparency was especially useful for locating the WASD keys at night, since they really pop out from the rest.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Helios Neo 16" class="wp-image-2022970" height="879" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Keyboard_edited.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>The Helios Neo 16&rsquo;s keyboard is large, flashy, spacious and &nbsp;has an excellent key selection.&nbsp;</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>The trackpad felt nice and responsive too, although I wasn&rsquo;t a fan of its positioning, which is a little to the left of center. This meant my left wrist had to get by with less space than my right and that my left thumb sometimes hit the trackpad by mistake. It wasn&rsquo;t that much of an issue, but noticeable nonetheless.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="acer-predator-helios-neo-16-ports">Acer Predator Helios Neo 16: Ports</h3>



<p>With five USB ports available, just about all my usual devices were comfortably homed around the Neo 16. Two of these ports, being the very useful Thunderbolt 4 kind, made downloading files at up to 40Gbps while simultaneously streaming to an external display as easy as pie. Two Thunderbolt 4s is one more than you&rsquo;ll see in some premium rivals too &ndash; so hurrah, what a treat!</p>

<p>I was very chuffed by the other ports on offer as well. I had a HDMI 2.1 port as an extra display option, a LAN port for my LAN cable and 3.5 mm combo jack for my headphones. I even had a Kensington lock, which I wasn&rsquo;t expecting in a laptop priced so low.</p>



<p>The port placement was spot on, too. In fact, the Neo 16&rsquo;s designer may well be a southpaw judging by the fact that the ports aren&rsquo;t bunched around the left side like you commonly see in some laptops. With the two Thunderbolt 4 ports, power and HDMI located along the back, I never felt cramped for space, despite the laptop&rsquo;s larger size.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="acer-predator-helios-neo-16-display-and-audio">Acer predator Helios Neo 16: Display and audio</h3>



<p>The Helios Neo 16&rsquo;s WUXGA display is beautifully framed up by ultra-thin bezels on the sides and top and the panel itself produces nicely saturated color images, but don&rsquo;t expect the kind of fluid motion you will see in panels with 240Hz refresh rates. Suffice to say, you will occasionally see some micro stuttering &ndash; especially when motion pans in from the far left or right. I only saw this occasionally, but it does make a 240Hz refresh rate a very desirable feature I&rsquo;d definitely want to have.</p>

<p>With only 400 nits of peak brightness, the Helios Neo 16&rsquo;s display also just scrapes by with passable contrast. This means you do occasionally lose some of the detail in images. The low peak brightness also means it doesn&rsquo;t do well in sunlight; it&rsquo;s best used inside on sunny days &ndash; so, sorry pool owners, you&rsquo;re going to have to take those pina coladas inside.</p>

<p>Acer have done well to get a discreet webcam into the top bezel&rsquo;s minuscule width. It&rsquo;s just a 720p camera, though. That said, it captures images and conveys voices reasonably well. Unfortunately, the laptop&rsquo;s speaker audio is less flattering. You could say it&rsquo;s the diet cola kind, when I was really hoping for the fully sugar-loaded variety.</p>



<p>By that I mean the audio was very quiet, even at full volume. It was also almost completely tuned for sounds in the mid and high tonal range. What bass notes I could hear landed with underwhelming taps rather than deep commanding thuds, which was a little disappointing.</p>

<p>Our Helios Neo 16 features the 16-core Core i7-13700HX processor from Intel&rsquo;s Raptor Lake processor series. This feeds 16GB of DDR 5 RAM operating at a maximum speed of 4800 MHz. Being a laptop with one of Intel&rsquo;s 13th-gen high-performance HX chips, I compared it against Asus&rsquo;s ROG Strix G16 which sports an Intel Core i7-1365HX and the Razer Blade 16 loaded with an Intel Core i9-13950HX.</p>



<p>Intel places the Core i7-13700HX&rsquo;s performance slightly above its Core i7-12850HX processor from last year&rsquo;s Alder Lake series. That being the case I was also curious to see how it would go up against the Core i7-12700H in a laptop like the Alienware X15 R2 as well.</p>



<p>The first benchmark I ran was Maxon&rsquo;s Cinebench R20 Multi-Threaded test. This benchmark flexes all the cores of a laptop&rsquo;s CPU to give an indication of how well it can handle CPU-intensive tasks. In this benchmark the Helios Neo 16&rsquo;s CPU finished in first place. This proves it can stand some hectic all-core flexing, the likes of which you&rsquo;ll get from running AAA games or encoding large files.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Helios Neo 16" class="wp-image-2023013" height="656" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cinebench-R20.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>That said, if you are working the CPU to its limits with an encoding job, the Helios Neo 16 may run out of steam a little quicker than some rival laptops, as judging by our HandBrake test result, represented in our next graph.</p>



<p>The HandBrake test, which involves encoding a large 30 MKV video file to MP4, gives us an indication of how well the laptop&rsquo;s CPU can keep its thermals under control and keep performance strong and steady to power on through a demanding CPU task.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Helios Neo 16" class="wp-image-2023028" height="609" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/HandBrake.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>As you can see, it took our review unit a little longer to finish encoding the 30MKV file than the majority of the comparison field. I&rsquo;m not particularly concerned by this result, however. Anything under 1,000 seconds is still considered relatively decent here. And, although the Neo 16 was a little off the pace, it&rsquo;s not by the kind of margin that would become frustrating or have you waiting around for an uncomfortably long time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="acer-predator-helios-neo-16-gaming-performance">Acer Predator Helios Neo 16: Gaming performance</h3>



<p>My review unit&rsquo;s Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 mobile GPU is considered approximately 18 percent faster in 1080p games than Nvidia&rsquo;s previous generation GPU, the GeForce RTX 3060 mobile. That&rsquo;s the general statistic; you simply can&rsquo;t tell how GPUs will perform from one laptop to another without proper benchmarking. Invariably, differences in internal componentry, cooling systems and Total Graphics Power (TGP) can all be factors that can result in different GPU performances. To get a firm sense, then, I ran our normal trifecta of PCWorld GPU tests.</p>



<p>First up was the 3DMark Time Spy benchmark which gives us a broad picture of graphical performance. The result? The Helios Neo 16 was a little off the pace of the Asus ROG Strix G16 which packed the same RTX 4060 mobile GPU. Still, a score in the 10,000s speaks of a laptop that will comfortably run AAA games and graphically demanding programs on it.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Helios Neo 16" class="wp-image-2023056" height="588" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Acer-Predator-Helios-Neo-16.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>Moving to our gaming benchmarks now, and in the <em>Rise of the Tomb Raider benchmark</em>, the Helios Neo 16 couldn&rsquo;t quite compete with the mostly premium comparisons which clocked higher frame per second scores. When taken at face value this seems like an underwhelming performance but taken into context of the laptop&rsquo;s budget price tag, this result is still quite good.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Helios Neo 16" class="wp-image-2023076" height="562" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/RoTTR.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>Besides, the difference in performance between our laptop and the three laptops directly above it in our graph is relatively minimal. A more important measure is how the Helios Neo 16 performed up against another highly capable budget gaming laptop, the<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1801913/asus-tuf-gaming-a16-advantage-edition-review.html"> Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition. </a>Here, we see it had the edge on this laptop by a hair.</p>



<p>Running the <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider </em>game benchmark elicited a somewhat better result for the Neo 16. In this benchmark our laptop placed where I would have expected it to place among the panoply of laptops in our review lineup &ndash; that is, not far off the pace of laptops with premium RTX 30 series GPUs, and above others with lower rung RTX 30 series GPUs.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Helios Neo 16" class="wp-image-2023123" height="571" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SoTTR.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="acer-predator-helios-neo-16-battery-performance">Acer Predator Helios Neo 16: Battery performance</h3>



<p>To test the battery performance, I looped a 4K movie on Windows Movie and TV app with the sound turned down to 50 percent and a cheap pair of headphones plugged in. I also turned off the keyboard backlighting and switched the laptop&rsquo;s wi-fi to airplane mode. The Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 lasted almost 9 hours &ndash; which is one of the better scores I&rsquo;ve seen this year. It beats out the Razer Blade 16 and Asus ROG Strix G16 for battery life but doesn&rsquo;t quite match the staying power of the Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition &ndash; which is exceptional.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Acer Predator Helios Neo 16" class="wp-image-2023146" height="585" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Neo-16-Battery-life.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>Mind you, almost mine hours is what you can expect the laptop&rsquo;s battery to last just playing a video file. For power hungry gaming, you can expect the Neo 16 to last a more modest five hours when unplugged from an AC outlet, which is still relatively good.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="acer-predator-helios-neo-16-should-you-buy-it">Acer Predator Helios Neo 16: Should you buy it?</h3>



<p>It goes without saying you&rsquo;re probably going to get less for your money when you buy a laptop that costs approximately $1,000 rather than a laptop that costs 3,000 to $4,000. But what do you compromise on for spending less &ndash; CPU / GPU power? Ports? A smaller display? A less than optional keyboard? Thankfully, you don&rsquo;t have to miss out on any of these all-important factors with the Helios Neo 16, which makes it an excellent value-for-money proposition for gamers on a budget.</p>
