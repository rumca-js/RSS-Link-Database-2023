<p dir="ltr">In a recent development, the Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game franchise has moved to block artists from using artificial intelligence technology in its imaginative portrayals of fantasy characters and settings. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/dungeons-dragons-ai-artificial-intelligence-dnd-wizards-of-coast-hasbro-b852a2b4bcadcf52ea80275fb7a6d3b">The Associated Press</a> is reporting that D&amp;D Beyond--a subsidiary of Hasbro and a creator of online tools and companion content for the franchise--was unaware until this past weekend that one of its longtime illustrators had used AI to create commissioned artwork for an upcoming book.</p><p dir="ltr">In response, the franchise is taking action to address the situation and establish clear guidelines for its artists. "He will not use AI for Wizards' work moving forward," stated a post from D&amp;D Beyond's account on X, formerly known as Twitter. "We are revising our process and updating our artist guidelines to make clear that artists must refrain from using AI art generation as part of their art creation process for developing D&amp;D."</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">On AI-generated art and Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants: <a href="https://t.co/q6oXRRITk9">pic.twitter.com/q6oXRRITk9</a></p>  — D&amp;D Beyond (@DnDBeyond) <a href="https://twitter.com/DnDBeyond/status/1687969469170094083?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">August 5, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">AI-generated art often exhibits telltale glitches, such as distorted limbs, which caught the attention of skeptical D&amp;D enthusiasts.

<p>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has explained his side of the story about what happened with Black Adam, one of the newest DC Studios movie franchises that is not moving ahead (at least not yet).</p><p>Speaking to Kevin Hart, The Rock said Black Adam was "caught in the vortex of new leadership" at DC Studios, referring to James Gunn and Peter Safran recently becoming the new studio co-heads.</p><p>"Any time you have a company, especially of that size and magnitude--it's a publicly traded company--and you have all those changes in leadership, you have people coming in who, creatively [and] fiscally are going to make decisions that you may not agree with philosophically," he said. "So I think Black Adam was one of those movies that got caught in that web of new leadership. That will always be one of the biggest mysteries, not only for me, but also throughout our business."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-rock-explains-what-happened-with-black-adam-vortex-of-new-leadership/1100-6516640/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

However, you don't necessarily need to avoid melee engagements altogether. By default, Druids have proficiencies in light armor, medium armor, and shields.

"Ghost of Tsushima is at its best when you're riding your horse and taking in the beautiful world on your own terms, armed with a sword and a screenshot button, allowing the environmental cues and your own curiosity to guide you. It's not quite a Criterion classic, but a lot of the time it sure looks like one."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-for-only-30/1100-6509288/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>For years now, Suicide Squad director David Ayer has distanced himself from the version of the movie that Warner Bros. released in 2016, saying he had other plans before studio executives made changes. Ayer has maintained that his version is superior, and now the director has suggested an "Ayer cut" might see the light of day now that James Gunn is a co-head of DC Studios.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/DavidAyerMovies/status/1688419559827726336">Writing on Twitter</a>, Ayer said, "Have you ever had an experience in life that didn't until the way you wanted, that dragged you, that made you rethink everything? I have." He added: "All I know is my unseen film plays much better than the studio release."</p><p>Ayer went on to say he believes there is a "real and organic" interest in seeing his cut of Suicide Squad be released one day. The director added that Gunn himself told him that the Ayer cut "would have its time to be shared," but it might not happen soon. Ayer said he doesn't want any drama about his 2016 film to take away from what Gunn and Peter Safran are trying to achieve at DC Studios going forward.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-director-says-james-gunn-supports-release-of-his-version/1100-6516634/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

One of those fans, <a href="https://twitter.com/CodyDaniels88/status/1684033312694865922">Cody Daniels</a>, got the chance to play a bit of Smash 64 with President Barack Obama as part of a Make-A-Wish in 2015, and he says the former Commander-In-Chief mains Captain Falcon--and what's more, he's not too shabby at the game, either.</p><div><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">Did you know the former President, Barack Obama, was a Captain Falcon main in Super Smash 64?<br />I had the pleasure to play with <a href="https://twitter.com/CodyDaniels88?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">@CodyDaniels88</a> on a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxPainMonday?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">@MaxPainMonday</a> stream who chatted about his experiences. <a href="https://t.co/wRR2S2srjF">pic.twitter.com/wRR2S2srjF</a></p>  — Tafo (@tafokints) <a href="https://twitter.com/tafokints/status/1687151653923983360?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">August 3, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Speaking to Smash community figure Tafo as part of a recent stream, Daniels said that he got to play Smash 64 with Obama at the White House.

<p>One of the biggest decisions you will have to make early on in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> is whether to take the mountain pass or Underdark to reach Moonrise Towers. Those that took the mountain pass might have missed out on a beautiful underground world in the Underdark, but they were rewarded with a lush landscape full of trees and scenic vistas. Another boon to taking the mountain pass is gaining access to both the Rosymorn Monastery and the Githyanki Creche. Both of these locations are the key sites in starting and finishing the Blood of Lathander quest in Baldur's Gate 3.</p><p>You start this quest at the Rosymorn Monastery by clicking on a plaque right below a statue of Lathander, just above the entrance to the Githyanki Creche. What happens next is an arduous and intricate quest that results in you receiving a powerful, legendary mace and perhaps dooming an entire community. Find out exactly how to complete the Blood of Lathander quest in the guide below.</p><div><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com">hide</a>]</span><ul class="collapse in" id="toc_list"><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com">Finding the secret weapons</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Finding_the_secret_weapons">Finding the secret weapons</h2><p>After starting the quest at the statue of Lathander, you want to head back up the stairs that took you down there. Once you're on the floor with different doors on either side of you, keep going until you reach the room with the large, stained glass window in the middle of the floor. This room also has four tables with two blue gems on them, and one of them has a glowing sword on it. <strong>Don't pick up this sword</strong>.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-how-to-get-the-blood-of-lathander/1100-6516604/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
