<p>Boots patrols the streets of Fisherman's Wharf. His goal is to scare people away from breaking into cars, armed with nothing than a non-lethal weapon that kinda looks like a gun. It is unclear what he is going to do now that he just admitted this on the network news.</p><p>We've been hearing for years about what a sh*thole San Francisco is turning into. Both literally with holes in the sidewalk filled with human homeless poop, as well as figuratively speaking:</p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-camera-store-robbery" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Store Owner Becomes Batman, Fights Off Punks With Baseball Bat During Another Smash and Grab">Store Owner Becomes Batman, Fights Off Punks With Baseball Bat During Another Smash and Grab</a></p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/smash-grab-new-jersey" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Shocking Video Shows $1M Smash-and-Grab Jewelry Store Robbery, Female Employee Thrown to the Ground">Shocking Video Shows $1M Smash-and-Grab Jewelry Store Robbery, Female Employee Thrown to the Ground</a></p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/kung-fu-san-francisco" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Progressive city crime is so bad, a cafe owner is forced to teach employees kung fu for their own protection">Progressive city crime is so bad, a cafe owner is forced to teach employees kung fu for their own protection</a></p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-target-lockdown-merch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: Video exposes how bad a Target has to lock down merchandise in San Francisco so it isn't stolen">Video exposes how bad a Target has to lock down merchandise in San Francisco so it isn't stolen</a></p><p><a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-desantis-mayor-responds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self" title="view post: San Francisco Mayor attacks DeSantis for calling city a cesspool, claims the drugs and poop are only a &quot;snapshot&quot;">San Francisco Mayor attacks DeSantis for calling city a cesspool, claims the drugs and poop are only a "snapshot"</a></p><p>Ignoring the problem hasn't stopped the problem. Defunding the police hasn't helped. Progressive voters voting for the same progressive politicians supporting the same progress policies and then wondering why you just got carjacked outside of a Benihana isn't working.

But he's the hero we have right now for content purposes.</p><p>Fair thee well, Boots, You have NOT failed this city.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## Watch: Tucker Carlson straight up murderizes a GOP presidential candidate over "one of the biggest issues in our country"

What's an 'Asa Hutchinson?'" If you saw the viral photo this week of presidential candidates speaking to a room of four people...that's Asa. He's also the former governor of Arkansas, and for some reason decided to run in the GOP primary for president. This isn't about his primary chances. This is about the WORST answer I've ever heard a presidential candidate give ever.</p><p>Today is the Family Leadership Conference in Iowa, the first major event for the Iowa Caucus. Not every GOP candidate had the courage to show up, but the ones that did sat down to answer questions from Tucker Carlson. Tucker asked Asa about vetoing a bill in 2021 as governor that would have banned genital mutilation surgery and prescribing permanently life-altering puberty blockers to minors.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>

<p>Asa hopes that we'll be able to talk about "some issues?" </p><p>GOP primary voters have various opinions of what the GOP is now vs what it was vs what it's never going back to being again. If the one thing we all agree on it's that the party that virtues signals about tax cuts and does little else is dead. No one told Asa about this before the decided to run for president.</p><p>Hutchinson's rationale for the veto was that it was "government overreach" and "not the role of government to... yackity schmackity." In a perfect world, sure. In 2023 when <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/california-legalize-child-kidnapping" target="_blank">Democrats support taking your children away from you if you don't "affirm" them</a> and <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/california-mom-daughter-transitioned" target="_blank">encourage schools to HIDE doing so from parents</a>, we need leaders who are going to fight and push back.</p><p>Banning minors from going on puberty blockers and having elective permanently scarring surgery isn't government overreach. It's common sense childhood-protection reforms. I don't know what party Asa Hutchinson thinks he's running to be standard barer for or who he confused Tucker Carlson of being.</p><p>But, dude. F*ck you.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><

## CNN pinned all their hopes and dreams on Kaitlan Collins and her new show is losing to SpongeBob: report

Her show debuted this past Monday, and there is both bad news and good news. And horrible news,</p><p>The good news is she was the second most-watched show on CNN!</p><p>The bad news is she was the third most-watched cable news show out of three cable news networks.</p><p>The horrible news? Instead of being the new Andrew Cuomo, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/brian-stelter-ratings" target="_blank">she is the new Brian Stelter</a>, falling behind decades of repeats of <em>Golden Girls</em>, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/south-park-girls-sports" target="_blank"><em>South Park</em></a>, and <em>Sponge Bob Squarepants</em>.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p><a href="https://radaronline.com/p/kaitlan-collins-cnn-debut-ratings-loses-to-sitcom-show-repeats/" target="_blank">RadarOnline reports</a> on July 10, <em>The Rachel Maddow Show</em> won the night with 2.41 million TOTAL viewers. <em>Hannity</em> came in second with 1.95 million. Collins's debut show only brought in 540,000 thousand viewers. That is 460,000 less than a million. In TOTAL viewers.</p><p>In the all-important 25-54 demographic, only 84,000 adults between the ages of 25 and 54 tuned in.

<p>Hosting a primetime show is a lot different from <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-lashes-out-reporter" target="_blank">getting verbally abused</a> by President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/joe-biden-lashes-out-again" target="_blank">whenever you ask a question</a>. It is unclear what CNN's metric for success is. While 540k/84k was embarrassing by television standards, it was still enough to make her the second most-watched show on CNN. The network may be happy it doesn't fall out of the top three behind OANN or NewsNation. So it all depends on your perspective on things.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><
