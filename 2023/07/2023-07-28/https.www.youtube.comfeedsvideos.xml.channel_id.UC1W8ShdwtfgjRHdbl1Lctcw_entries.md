I colorized, restored and applied face restoration and created a sound design for this video of Street Scenes in San Sebastián, Spain 1913, You can clearly see what's going on in broad daylight And the daily lives of the people living in the city at that time.

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound design only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
