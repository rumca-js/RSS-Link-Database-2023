I\u2019m not saying he handled the situation in the most legal fashion, nor will I say this is the best way to deal with porch thieves.

And if that sounds like bullplop to you, it does to the NYPD as well.</p><p>The story we're told, via their publicist, is that the couple was leaving the Ziegfeld Ballroom in Midtown on Tuesday night. When an angry mom of paparazzi attacked the usual camera-shy, now former-royal, couple. This, ahem,  \"ring of highly aggressive paparazzi\" was in hot pursuit of the couple in a way that made it sound like a Fast and Furious movie. In New York City. </p><p>Though Harry could learn a thing or two from Dom Toretto <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/primce-harry-60-minutes\" target=\"_blank\">about not turning your back on family</a>.</p><blockquote>\u201cThis relentless pursuit, lasting over two hours, resulted in multiple near collisions involving other drivers on the road, pedestrians and two NYPD officers,\u201d the spokesperson said.</blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"0004b\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33699049&amp;width=980\" />\n</p><p>Comparisons were drawn to Harry's mother Princess Diana, who was killed in a car accident after an actual relentless pursuit by paparazzi. Emphasis on \"actual.\"</p><p>Set aside that it would defy logic that there would be ANY hot pursuit in Manhattan, what with the city's notorious traffic and congestion. The NYPD is now calling into question how \"in peril\" the former-royal couple was, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2023/05/17/harry-meghan-car-chase-definitely-not-two-hours-source/\" target=\"_blank\">according to the New York Post</a>.</p><blockquote>\u201cThe NYPD assisted the private security team protecting the Duke and Duchess of Sussex,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThere were numerous photographers that made their transport challenging. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrived at their destination and there were no reported collisions, summonses, injuries, or arrests in regard.\u201d</blockquote><blockquote>A high-ranking source added that there were \u201cno collision reports or 911 calls\u201d and that the chase \u201cdefinitely wasn\u2019t two hours.\u201d</blockquote><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"038f2\" src=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.gif?id=33699045&amp;width=980\" />\n</p>\n<p>Turns out the couple was being over dramatic. Shocking, I know. Because the couple hates attention. So much so that Meghan Markle wanted to <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/south-park-meghan-markle-harry\" target=\"_blank\">sue South Park for mocking them as attention whores</a>.</p><p>No paparazzi were injured in this incident.
