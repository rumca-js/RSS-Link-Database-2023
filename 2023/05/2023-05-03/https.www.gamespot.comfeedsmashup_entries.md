## Reggie Threatens To Go Liam Neeson Mode On Early Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Player

<p>Former Nintendo of America COO Reggie Fils-Aimé has echoed Liam Neeson's action star turn in response to someone posting a screenshot of an early-obtained copy of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p>A Twitter user, who has since deleted their account, posted a photo of them pointing their finger at the title art of Tears of the Kingdom on the Nintendo Switch home menu. Reggie quote tweeted this image with the text "I don't know what you want. What I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career, skills that make me a nightmare for people like you." The tweet is a paraphrase of Liam Neeson's famous lines from Taken, which kick-started the actor's second career as an action star.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I don't know what you want. What I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career, skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.&rdquo; <a href="https://t.co/jjweQapCTd">https://t.co/jjweQapCTd</a></p>  &mdash; Reggie Fils-Aim&eacute; (@Reggie) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reggie/status/1653843761221324807?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">May 3, 2023</a></blockquote>              </div><p>By what means the original poster obtained this copy is unknown. However, that doesn't mean they acquired it illicitly, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warning-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-spoilers-are-apparently-in-the-wild/1100-6513722/">several customers have received physical copies early</a>. Given that he is no longer affiliated with Nintendo, Reggie's tweet is just a joke. However, the company has come down hard on pirates and leakers in the recent past. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bowser-sentenced-to-more-than-three-years-in-prison/1100-6500590/">Hacker Gary Bowser was sentenced to 40-months in prison</a> for enabling Nintendo Switch piracy. He has since been released early, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-hacker-gary-bowser-released-from-prison-but-he-still-owes-a-lot-of-money/1100-6513332/">Nintendo will take 25-30% of his future income until his debt to the company is repaid</a>.</p>

## Chasing Leads And Breaking Hearts Is The Least Of Your Concerns In Times & Galaxy

<p>Times &amp; Galaxy, a choice-driven adventure game in which you play as a robot who is the latest intern for the solar system's most trusted news holopaper, hits a little close to home for me. It delves into storylines anyone in online media will be familiar with, such as "your outlet is successful but not increasingly profitable and so you and many of your coworkers are being let go" or "you're not being hired full-time and getting employee benefits but good news, your writing is good enough that your part-time contract is being renewed <em>again</em>."</p><p dir="ltr">Copychaser Games' upcoming title feels quite timely given the current state of the video game journalism industry. It's not all doom and gloom, though, as most of the game seems geared towards exploring the joys of being a journalist and giving the player a sneak peek into the euphoric high that comes with finally getting that one quote you've been looking for, that one source who gives you what you need to print the reported story you've been chasing. There are also plenty of moments of levity and humor as well, keeping the mood from becoming too dour.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahead of its release, I played a demo for Times &amp; Galaxy that included the opening levels of the game. Even if its formula does feel specifically suited for the experience of playing as an investigative reporter hunting for clues, Times &amp; Galax's gameplay isn't wholly unique. Saying the right thing to the right person after discovering the right clue when you travel to the right spot is a hallmark of almost all choice-driven adventure games after all. But it's how Times &amp; Galaxy frames this familiar gameplay setup that makes the experience interesting.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chasing-leads-and-breaking-hearts-is-the-least-of-your-concerns-in-times-galaxy/1100-6513815/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## We Didn't Trust The Mandalorian's Armorer Because She Acts Exactly Like A Dark Souls NPC

<p dir="ltr">Since her very first appearance, the Armorer has been a mysterious character on Disney+'s The Mandalorian. When the penultimate episode of the show's third season was titled "The Spies," fans immediately began to theorize that the Armorer, the very person who had led the Tribe for some time, was the titular spy. That turned out not to be true, as no spy was uncovered among the Mandalorians, and it even seems like they may have been going for something more like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Spies">Biblical usage of the word</a>. But you're right to be suspicious of the Armorer all the same, because she's basically a Dark Souls NPC--some of the most notoriously treacherous characters in gaming.</p><p dir="ltr">While The Mandalorian itself hardly has Dark Souls vibes, everything about the Armorer seems to. When Mando finds her, she's working in a secretive underground forgery in the sewers. As far as we can tell as viewers, the Armorer never leaves this space until it's time to migrate to a new hideout for the Children of the Watch. She just lives down there in the sewer, endlessly hammering away at Beskar, like so many other NPCs you encounter in FromSoft games, from Andre the Smith in Dark Souls to Elden Ring's Gideon Ofnir (not to mention that her helmet bears a <em>striking</em> resemblance to Gideon's).</p><figure style="width: 1200px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4133550-1575024-gideon-ofnir-article_cover_bd-1.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4133550-1575024-gideon-ofnir-article_cover_bd-1.jpg" /></a></figure><p dir="ltr"> </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-didnt-trust-the-mandalorians-armorer-because-she-acts-exactly-like-a-dark-souls-npc/1100-6513784/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Every Failed Or Lost Star Wars Movie And TV Show Since The Very Beginning

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4132971-kotor.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">For many years, it seemed like Star Wars just could not fail. Even given the middling responses to the sequel trilogy throughout the 2010s, Star Wars movies have been huge moneymakers for Lucasfilm and, later, Disney. A shift in the last few years in fan sentiment and a rash of canceled projects, though, has shown us that, yes, even the never-repeated cultural juggernaut that is Star Wars can hit rough patches. Looking back throughout the franchise's history, though, there are a bunch of scrapped projects and a few that are disappointing enough to warrant mention even though they hit the finish line--we're talking about you, Star Wars Holiday Special.</p><p dir="ltr">The following list covers every movie or series that we could find that fits those criteria: the canceled, the failed, and the forgotten Star Wars projects. Some of these projects were deep into development, with dozens of episodes already written when the axe came down. Some were announced to great fanfare, only to disappear from release slates later.</p><p dir="ltr">The creators behind these projects include George Lucas himself, Zack Snyder, and even Marvel Studios' Kevin Feige. Check out our list below, which is in no particular order, and decide for yourself if any of these projects rival the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Star Wars: Underworld (2005)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4132962-star-wars-underworld.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Star Wars: Underworld might be the most influential show that never existed. Back in 2005, George Lucas was still in charge of Star Wars and had the idea to bring Star Wars to the small screen as a live-action television show. The project was in development for some time, with over 50 42-minute scripts having been written. <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a359399/star-wars-tv-series-to-be-called-star-wars-underworld/">According to producer Rick McCallum</a>, the series would "focus on criminal and political power struggles in the 'period when the Empire is trying to take things over.'"</p><p dir="ltr">The series was, as you'd expect, very expensive to make, and that kept it from ever reaching full production. It's one thing to imagine a story, and another thing entirely to make all the parts needed to bring it to life. "We can't walk down the street of New York City and start filming. We have to create the world. It's constant world-building. Every ship, every speeder bike, every bit of costuming, everything has to be created. So it's a huge expense," Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/05/star-wars-may-the-4th-underworld">told Vanity Fair</a> last year.</p><p dir="ltr">And yet, it helped pave the way for shows to come, like The Mandalorian, Obi-Wan, and the upcoming Ahsoka. Lucas himself said that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ewan-mcgregor-on-obi-wan-series-using-epics-tech-and-the-luke-skywalker-rumors/1100-6490716/">StageCraft technology</a> that helped make The Mandalorian possible was exactly what he wanted for the show, and Star Wars creative lead Dave Filoni, responsible for much of the direction of the Star Wars computer-animated series like Clone Wars and Rebels, has said that the scripts for Underworld are mined internally for ideas for future Star Wars material.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Star Wars: Detours (2012)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4132963-star-wars-robot-chicken.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Every big acquisition results in a few casualties. When Disney acquired Lucasfilm in 2012, Star Wars: Detours became one of them. The series, created by Seth Green and Matthew Senreich of Robot Chicken fame, had produced 39 episodes, with another 62 scripts written, when Disney shelved it indefinitely before any of it aired.</p><p dir="ltr">The series was to be a parody show in the vein of the creative duo's other show, but with an eye toward younger audiences. The series was to feature lots of well-known celebrity voices, both from those with previous Star Wars experience and otherwise. Lucas himself was directly involved, even poking fun at himself by providing some voice work for the show. Green has <a href="https://ew.com/tv/star-wars-detours-disney-lucasfilm-seth-green/">subsequently said</a> that, despite fans calling for release of the finished episodes, there's no interest within Disney to release the series.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Rangers of the New Republic (2020)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4132964-star-wars-rangers.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Star Wars fans love a story about guys with laser swords and guys with cool warrior helmets, and it's even better when you can combine them. For years, though, Disney and Lucasfilm have been trying to tell stories about what happens elsewhere in the galaxy. Rangers of the New Republic is one of the more prominent examples. The show was announced back in December 2020. Lucasfilm was pretty cagey about what exactly the show would cover, but there was word that it would star Gina Carano's character, Cara Dune, from The Mandalorian and Paul Sun-Hyung Lee's X-Wing pilot, Captain Teva, as it followed the adventures of soldiers defending the New Republic against Imperial remnants.</p><p dir="ltr">Lucasfilm has stopped pursuing the show since its announcement, however. While Disney didn't explicitly say as much, it seems possible that this was due in part to opinions expressed by Gina Carano about transgender people. Disney distanced itself from the actor in 2021 and updated viewers about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-the-mandalorian-season-3-wrote-gina-carano-off-the-show/1100-6511928/">Cara Dune's whereabouts in Mandalorian Season 3</a>, with seemingly no plans to revisit the character.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Jedi Temple Challenge (2020)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4132965-jedi-temple-challenge.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">In June 2020, the still fairly fresh Disney+ streaming service was in great need of new content from its biggest licenses. And so Disney did what any company would do with a fun new kids' show like Jedi Temple Challenge: launch it over on YouTube and not make a single mention of it on Disney+.</p><p dir="ltr">Indeed, Jedi Temple Challenge can still be found over on the Star Wars Kids YouTube channel. The show is a Legends of the Hidden Temple-style elimination competition show aimed at kids and kid contestants. Ahmed Best--the voice behind Jar-Jar Binks--played the part of Jedi Master Kelleran Beq for the show, acting as its host alongside his droid assistant AD-3, who was voiced by Mary Holland. Jedi Temple Challenge was received well throughout its 10-episode run. Most Star Wars fans, however, have never heard of the show, and there's no word of Disney and Lucasfilm looking to make more. The show lives on in Ahmed Best, who reprised his role from the show in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everything-to-know-about-the-mandalorians-shocking-new-jedi-cameo/1100-6512584/">flashback sequence during The Mandalorian Season 3</a>, but that's the only sign of life from it since.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Star Wars Holiday Special (1978)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4132966-star-wars-holiday-special.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">The Star Wars Holiday Special is one of the worst Star Wars things to ever exist, one of the best-known Star Wars projects outside of the movies, and somehow also an indication of things to come (even if we didn't know that for 40 years). The 98-minute TV special was lambasted by critics at the time, and decades of chances to reexamine it haven't done it many favors. The special aired in 1978, between Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back. In the special, Han and Chewie go to Chewie's home planet of Kashyyyk to visit his family--wife Malla, son Lumpy, and father Itchy--to celebrate Life Day. The pair is being pursued by Imperial officers, though, and Imperials show up at Chewbacca's home before he and Han can get there.</p><p dir="ltr">The special included celebrity cameos as well as variety and musical acts. Most of the Star Wars cast at least cameoed in the show. While it's mostly infamous for how silly and cheesy the whole thing is, it also marks the first appearance of Boba Fett and Mandalorian armor in the Star Wars universe. Fett appeared in an animated segment before showing up in Empire Strikes Back in 1980. It's generally a really weird program; despite being a big Star Wars production, the whole thing is deeply tied to the pop culture of the time, so they would introduce acts and segments by having them appear as holovid transmissions or segments would be labeled as "required viewing for all Imperial officers."</p><p dir="ltr">Between Boba Fett's appearance and the idea of a huge live-action Star Wars television production, it's safe to say that while the program itself is not well-liked, it wasn't devoid of good ideas.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Rogue Squadron (2020)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4132968-rogue-squardon.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>When Star Wars literature became really big in the 1980s and 1990s, Michael Stackpole and Aaron Allston's X-Wing books were a favorite among fans who were more interested in the military aspects of the franchise than in the Skywalkers and Jedi. The 10 novels followed X-Wing pilots like Wedge Antilles rather than focusing on the more traditional characters. Lucasfilm announced alongside Rangers of the New Republic in 2020 that director Patty Jenkins (Wonder Woman) would be making a Rogue Squadron movie for the studio. Plot details are basically non-existent, and it's unknown whether it would've followed Wedge or some other pilots instead. Like Rangers, though, updates on the movie eventually petered out before the movie was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-rogue-squadron-movie-could-come-back-in-some-form-kathleen-kennedy-says/1100-6513078/">shelved</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Rebel Moon (2023)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4132969-zack-snyders-rebel-moon.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Zack Snyder is most associated with DC superheroes these days, but at one point, he had his eyes set on Star Wars. Sometime between 2005 and 2012--the end of the Prequel trilogy and the sale of Lucasfilm to Disney--Snyder pitched a movie to Lucasfilm that was meant to be a more mature take on the Star Wars universe. The pitch never got traction, though, and Snyder would eventually begin working on it as an original science-fiction movie not connected to Star Wars in any way. That pitch would become the movie that Snyder currently working on, Rebel Moon, which is set to release on December 22, 2023.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Obi-Wan (2022)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4132970-ewan-mcgregor-as-obi-wan-kenobi.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>Films focused on Jedi Masters Obi-Wan and Yoda were being developed at one time, as was a movie based on Jabba the Hutt. While Yoda and Jabba would never get their movies, the Obi-Wan project eventually transformed into the Disney+ series Obi-Wan series that aired in May 2022.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Knights of the Old Republic movie</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4132971-kotor.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>One of the most beloved properties in Star Wars history is the 2003 video game Knights of the Old Republic, which was set thousands of years before the Skywalker Saga and followed an unnamed Jedi hunting a Sith Lord named Darth Revan. In 2019, <a href="https://twitter.com/MTVNEWS/status/1118270840989192192?s=20">Kathleen Kennedy confirmed to MTV News</a> that "we are developing something to look at, but right now I have no idea where things might fall." Shutter Island and Alita: Battle Angel writer Laeta Kalogridis reportedly wrote a script for the first of a potential trilogy, but nothing has been said about the film since.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. A whole bunch of Star Wars spin-off movies</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1603/16030002/4132972-boba-fett.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p>In 2013, long before JJ Abrams brought the Star Wars universe back to cinemas kicking and screaming with The Force Awakens, Disney was considering a movie focused on Boba Fett set during the original trilogy, with X-Men movie writer Simon Kinberg to pen the script. Fantastic Four director Josh Trank was announced in 2014 to be directing another spin-off but reportedly left the project a year later due to creative differences.</p><p>Game of Thrones TV show creators D.B. Weiss and David Benioff were going to produce a whole trilogy, as was The Last Jedi director <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/whats-going-on-with-the-star-wars-movies-from-rian-johnson-taika-waititi-lucasfilm-president-responds/1100-6513098/">Rian Johnson</a>--both deals have since fallen apart. Director J.D. Dillard and Luke Cage writer Matt Owens were also looking into directing a film set on the Sith planet Exegol, which was seen in The Rise of Skywalker. Finally, Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige was reportedly developing a Star Wars film for Lucasfilm--both studios are part of Disney--but Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy has since clarified that the film was never in active development.</p></h3></p><br />

<p>In a world's first, scientists have observed a star completely swallowing up a planet, a phenomenon that will also happen to our own sun one day, killing us all.</p><p>Astronomers have, for the first time, witnessed a star, not unlike our sun, completely guzzling up a gas giant about the size of Jupiter, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/star-eats-planet-galactic-gulp-660ef9e64e15e35f8ad820e032494704">according to the AP</a>. This will happen to the Earth, too, when our own sun eventually becomes a red giant and wipes out our planet. The good news, though, is that this shouldn't happen for another 5 billion years, co-author Morgan MacLeod said.</p><p>Anyone alive today won't have to suffer this fate, thankfully, and it's an open question whether or not humanity will be around in 5 billion years anyway. But whatever is left of our Earth in 5 billion years will be gobbled up and destroyed in spectacular fashion.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-swallows-planet-in-one-gulp-foreshadowing-how-we-will-all-die-here-on-earth/1100-6513810/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The Season 3 Reloaded update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii/">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20/">Warzone 2</a> is just a week away, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-adds-a-literal-rat-and-famous-nba-star-as-new-operator-options-in-season-3-reloaded/1100-6513803/">Kevin Durant operator bundle</a> is already confirmed for the big update.

## Every Star Wars Movie and TV Show Ranked, From A New Hope to Andor

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133395-allstarwarsmoviesandshowsranked.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">We already spend far too much time thinking about Star Wars as it is, and that ratchets up to 11 around May the 4th, a silly pun meme that was turned into a fake holiday devoted to everybody's favorite space fantasy franchise. Naturally, there's no better time of year to argue about which pieces of the incredibly expansive Star Wars franchise are the best.</p><p dir="ltr">It can certainly be easy to forget the full breadth of the Star Wars franchise, since there are so many old chunks that very few people care about anymore. But since the franchise remains one of the biggest ever, it's all been preserved and is available on Disney+. Except, of course, the original versions of the original Star Wars trilogy--only the updated, worse versions of those films are available to stream legally.</p><p dir="ltr">So if you've forgotten what all there is to watch in this franchise, we've assembled a ranked list of every Star Wars movie and TV show that's ever been released, from the ones you know (like the three movie trilogies) to ones you've forgotten ever happened (like the Ewoks and Droids cartoons from the 1980s). Except the Lego Star Wars specials. You're on your own with those.</p><p dir="ltr">You're gonna wanna strap in, because this journey is not going to be a short one.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>27. The Ewok Adventures</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133356-theewokadventures.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>This pair of TV movies from the 1980s about some kids who get marooned on Endor are quite bad and don't really fit with the rest of the franchise. These days it just seems weird that these even got made, but that does add some novelty value as a strange vision of what Star Wars might have become had these movies been a success.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>25. The Book of Boba Fett</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133348-thebookofbobafettrancor.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>There were a couple decent episodes in that first season (like the one that Boba Fett wasn't in), but otherwise the Book of Boba Fett was like a vision of what Star Wars would look like on The CW. And that's not great, Bob.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>24. Ewoks</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133365-ewoksshow.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>An animated TV show that followed up the live-action Ewok Adventure TV movies, Ewoks was pretty generic and not all that entertaining most of the time. And it's just so bizarre to see them speaking English. They obviously had to do that--you can't do an entire show for 6-year-olds in a fake language. But it remains super weird.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>23. Droids</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133364-starwarsdroidsshow.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>It's better than the Ewoks animated series--though that sentiment may be more a comment on the choice of subject matter than it is on the quality of the show. In other words: I'd rather watch a 1980s children's TV cartoon about C-3PO and R2-D2 than one about Ewoks. Does that mean Droids was a good show? Not really.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>22. The Rise of Skywalker</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133317-theriseofskywalkerjjdroids.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">All three Disney sequels were terrible in their own ways, but Rise of Skywalker managed to achieve a new level of egregious thoughtlessness. We're talking about a movie where they literally resurrected the Emperor offscreen, after neither of the previous two movies had foreshadowed that in any way. It's the nadir of Star Wars.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>21. Star Wars Holiday Special</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133404-starwarsholidayspeciql.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>A TV special that originally aired during the 1978 holiday season, the Star Wars Holiday Special--in which Han and Chewbacca bring the whole gang back to Chewie's home planet to celebrate the in-universe Life Day holiday--is a strange and hokey relic of the past that's impossible to critically evaluate at this point. It may not be "good," but it remains an adorable and amusing novelty.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>20. Solo</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133323-soloastarwarsstoryl337.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Coming off the rather bizarre Clone Wars theatrical movie, I don't know how high anybody's hopes were for this computer-animated series back then. But it was surprisingly enjoyable, and it tapped into something very important that the prequel movies had mostly glossed over: how this war led to Anakin's fall to the dark side. It felt like a necessary piece of the story, which has not really been the case with more recent animated series.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>19. Resistance</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133354-starwarsresistance.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>All the Star Wars animated series are at least partially geared specifically toward children. It's just the nature of these things. But while shows like Clone Wars and Rebels also have things to offer those of us who aren't children, Star Wars: Resistance doesn't, really.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>18. The Bad Batch</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4131093-thebadbatch.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The most recent animated series is a strange mixed bag. It's got quite a compelling focus, dealing with rogue clone soldiers trying to make their way through the universe well after the Clone Wars have ended. But, frankly, the animation is obnoxiously stiff, and it's pretty distracting.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>17. Obi-Wan Kenobi</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133358-obi-wankenobishowlittleleia.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>This felt like a show at war with itself. With its overreliance on low-quality CGI, it was impossible to take the Obi-Wan show as seriously as its story wanted us to. Whereas with Andor, the Star Wars-ness of the whole thing took a backseat to the story being told, Obi-Wan Kenobi was more focused on delivering a Star Wars aesthetic that comes with a story attached to it.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>16. The Force Awakens</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133314-theforceawakenstheraidguys.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>JJ Abrams' first bad Star Wars movie had the exact opposite problem the prequels had: It nails the aesthetic of Star Wars, but its storytelling is as thoroughly incompetent as it could have been. Remember the rathtar scene? No? That's what I thought. Yeah, this movie is worse than you think.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>15. Rebels</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133339-themandalorianchapter23eastereggsthrawn.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>There were times on this animated series where it felt like it was about to move itself beyond its cartoon niche. But there would always be something--like the Inquisitors using their lightsabers as helicopter blades so they could fly--that prevented it from quite getting there.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>14. Attack of the Clones</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133253-attackoftheclonesyoda.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Every scene looks like digital vomit, and it's so badly edited that it made Natalie Portman seem like she's bad at acting. In terms of sheer filmmaking craft, it doesn't get any worse than this.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>13. The Last Jedi</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133316-thelastjediporg.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Director Rian Johnson managed to put together a Star Wars movie that was full of really cool visuals that felt legitimately like I was seeing something new in Star Wars for the first time in a long time. Unfortunately, the story is nothing more than a subversion of The Force Awakens that is simultaneously remixing The Empire Strikes Back. It's braindead, and two and a half hours is far too long for a movie that has nothing going for it other than being nice to look at.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>12. Revenge of the Sith</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133313-revengeofthesithgeneralgrievous.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>It might be that kids today aren't as alarmed and disgusted by horrendously awful CGI now that movie and TV studios use bad visual effects like a crutch. But for me, it's hard to find any meaningful drama in the clash between Anakin and Obi-Wan when it's taking place in a comically abysmal-looking digital lava field.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>11. 3D Clone Wars</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133338-3dclonewars.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Coming off the rather bizarre Clone Wars theatrical movie, I don't know how high anybody's hopes were for this computer-animated series back then. But it was surprisingly enjoyable, and it tapped into something very important that the prequel movies had mostly glossed over: how this war led to Anakin's fall to the dark side. It felt like a necessary piece of the story, which has not really been the case with more recent animated series.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. The Mandalorian</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133347-themandalorian.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Sometimes, the first live-action Star Wars show takes itself seriously, and when that happens, it's sublime. But most of the time it's just a 1990s-quality network adventure show like Hercules or Xena, that's primarily focused on making references to other Star Wars things. Unfortunately, it's not the '90s anymore, so it's bad that it's like that.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Rogue One</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133330-rogueonemoneyshotthatwasn%27tinthemovie.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>It's a weird, incoherent, hacked-together piece of nonsense that was primarily advertised with scenes that aren't in it--such as the one pictured above, which was the centerpiece of the ad campaign even after the movie had been released. There may have been a decent movie in here at some point, but it got lost when they reshot half of it after director Gareth Edwards delivered his first rough cut.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. The Phantom Menace</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133252-thephantommenacejarjar.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>It's hard to tell if it's actually any better than Attack of the Clone or Revenge of the Sith--it's got way more Jar Jar, so that's not a point in its favor unless you're <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jar-jar-binks-is-good-and-the-obi-wan-disney-show-needs-him/1100-6503670/">into that sort of thing</a>. But it's the only one of those three movies that was shot on film--making it the best by default because it's the only prequel that managed to mostly match the aesthetic of the rest of the franchise.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Tales of the Jedi</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133352-talesofthejedi.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>An anthology series with half-length, 12-to-15-minute episodes, Tales of the Jedi hits the sweet spot for Star Wars animation with stories that simply don't have enough time to get bogged down in, well, anything. These episodes get to the point and contain some actual substance that could give you a better understanding of the Star Wars universe.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. 2D Clone Wars</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133337-2dclonewarsshow.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Genndy Tartakovsky's original 2D Clone Wars series was made up of bite-sized episodes that now form an oddly structured two-part mini-series on Disney+. And it's aged surprisingly well in this form--Tartakovsky's animation style is still a trip, and watching this show all together like this instead of in small chunks is frankly a pretty unique experience for this franchise. There's nothing else like it under the Star Wars label.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Visions</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4133353-visions.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Lucasfilm let a bunch of Japanese animation studios do Star Wars their way--the idea here was for these studios to "reimagine" existing Star Wars ideas and stories in inventive new ways--and it turned out to be the best collection of Star Wars animation ever. There might be a lesson there.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Return of the Jedi</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4131170-returnofthejedi.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Some people think one or more of the prequels is better than Return of the Jedi, and I'm going to very generously say that those people are, at best, misguided. Every Star Wars movie made since 1983 has had at least ten things dumber than Ewoks, and not a single one of them had anything as great as the whole Jabba's Palace sequence.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. A New Hope</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4131094-starwars1anewhope.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Being the originator of a franchise as sprawling as Star Wars will inevitably be awkward--nothing about it is that well fleshed out, and stylistically it's pretty different from any Star Wars stuff of the past decade. But considering how most of the Star Wars franchise has been essentially just ripping this movie off instead of trying to advance the plot in any way--and how truly, deeply good A New Hope is by contrast--the original remains really tough to beat. That said, nearly every change that George Lucas made to this movie from the 1997 Special Edition to the Blu-ray release made it meaningfully worse. It's a joke that there is no current official release of the original version of this movie.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Andor</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4131059-everystarwarstshowandmovieranked.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>This Disney+ series is the first live-action Star Wars thing since the original trilogy that's simply a story being told that happens to be taking place in the Star Wars galaxy. It wasn't constructed to intrusively remind you in every scene that it's Star Wars, and it doesn't feel like the product of an algorithm designed to appeal to Star Wars nerds. That it's actually great is a really nice bonus.</p><p>One note, though: Andor would be behind A New Hope and Return of the Jedi in these rankings if the original cuts of those movies were readily available.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. The Empire Strikes Back</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4131163-theempirestrikesbaback.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>It's been the best Star Wars movie since the day it was released in theaters in 1980, and it remains so today because it's just that well-made. Director Irvin Kirshner is a forgotten figure at this point since everybody associates the originals with Lucas, but credit where it's due. Kirshner, who also directed the great RoboCop 2, really defined the big screen vibe of Star Wars in a big way with this film.</p></h3></p><br />

<p dir="ltr">There are a number of elements to the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-guardian-games-2023-guide-medallions-armor-new-scout-rifle-and-exotic/1100-6513782/">2023 edition of the Guardian Games</a> event in Destiny 2, but it largely centers around accumulating medallions and then cashing those in to help your class compete with the other two. Platinum medallions in particular offer the most progress and will also help you to progress a number of event challenges that allow you to earn various rewards. Fortunately, there's an easy way to quickly farm platinum medallions, provided you don't mind a bit of a mindless, loot cave-esque loop.</p><p dir="ltr">The central means of obtaining platinum medallions is by purchasing any of the Platinum Cards from Eva at the Tower. There are six of these in total and they can be repeatedly indefinitely, provided you can afford the modest cost of 1,500 Glimmer. (You also can't hold more than one for PvE and one for PvP/Gambit at a time.) But whereas some of these involve taking on a more time-intensive task, like completing a raid, the Platinum Cards - Neptune option provides a quicker route, provided you game the system a bit.</p><p dir="ltr">At least for this first week of the event, purchasing this Card will get you the Platinum Protector bounty. This asks you to defeat enemies on Neptune in one of several specific activities, with bonuses for Void and Strand final blows:</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-easily-farm-platinum-medallions-in-destiny-2-guardian-games-2023/1100-6513809/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/3977225-dek.jpg" /><br /><h3><p dir="ltr">Star Wars: A New Hope was released over 45 years ago, and over the course of almost five decades, the film franchise has had a plethora of memorable moments. From the opening crawl with John Williams' score blasting its stirring anthem, to Lando Calrissian blatantly flirting with Leia right in Han Solo's face, to Emperor Palpatine finally (Finally!) getting his comeuppance, Star Wars is the gift that keeps on giving. And as we celebrate Star Wars Day (May the 4th), we thought what time was better to look back on the best gifts the series has given us, as fans.</p><p dir="ltr">We all have moments that stir our Star Wars soul and over the course of the nine Skywalker Saga and two anthology films, there have been plenty of them. However, which of those favorite moments actually had the biggest impact on the adventures of some of the most beloved characters in movie history? What are the important and long-lasting moments that shaped the course of Star Wars?</p><p dir="ltr">Here are our picks for the 20 most pivotal moments in Star Wars movie history. Did your favorite moment miss the cut or not rank as high as you'd like? Let us know in the comments below.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>20. The Bodyguard - Star Wars: Attack of the Clones (Episode II)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/3977243-018.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>At the beginning of Attack of the Clones, a failed assassination attempt on Padme (Natalie Portman) leads to Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) recommending to the Jedi Council that her old friend, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), protect her. The future emperor does this knowing full well that Anakin (Hayden Christensen) is Kenobi's apprentice and likely his feelings for Padme. The two gradually fall in love. Romantic relationships are forbidden in the Jedi order, making this one of many steps by Palpatine to put a wedge between Anakin and the Jedis.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>19. Darth Maul lives - Solo: A Star Wars Story</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/3977245-020.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>At the end of Solo: A Star Wars Story viewers learn that it's not actually Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany) in charge of the Crimson Dawn crime syndicate. After killing Vos, Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke) chats via hologram with its true leader, Darth Maul, voiced by Sam Witwer and played physically by Ray Park, reprising his Phantom Menace role. It's unclear what his live-action future holds for Maul but his return is sure to shake up the Star Wars universe, even if some of his fate has been detailed in the Clone Wars and Rebels animated series.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>18. Rey doesn't sell BB-8 - Star Wars: The Force Awakens (Episode VII)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/3977244-019.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>When Rey (Daisy Ridley) rescues BB-8 from a scavenger she has no idea that the tiny droid is carrying the missing piece of an intergalactic map that will help the rebels find Luke Skywalker. Rey briefly considers selling BB-8 for food rations while bartering with Unkar Plutt (Simon Pegg) at Niima Outpost but eventually decides against it. It’s a move that sets Rey on her path with the Force and the alliance.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>17. Chirrut takes a walk - Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/3977241-016.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>Near the end of Rogue One, Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), and K-2SO (Alan Tudyk) have secured the schematics to the Death Star but can't transmit them to the rebels because the shield around Scarif prevents it. In order to drop the shields, blind, Force-sensitive warrior Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen) walks through a volley of blaster fire and turns off the master switch, allowing the shield to come down and the transmission to go through.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>16. Han shoots first - Star Wars: A New Hope (Episode IV)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/3977242-017.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>Despite George Lucas’s attempt to retcon Han Solo to make everyone's favorite scoundrel look more like John Wayne and less like a gunslinger, Star Wars fans all know the truth. Han shooting Greedo first in the cantina established the character not as a cold-blooded killer as Lucas had feared but as a badass who doesn't hesitate when action is required.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>15. Rey saves Ben Solo - The Rise of Skywalker (Episode IX)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/3977240-015.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>On Kef Bir, the ocean moon of Endor, Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) get in an epic battle on top of the destroyed remains of the second Death Star. Distracted when he senses his mother’s death, Ren drops his lightsaber which Rey grabs and then stabs him in the abdomen, ending the fight. Rey then Force heals Ren, unlocking him from the prison of the Dark Side and changing his fate and that of both Rey and the rebellion.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>14. Obi-Wan has the high ground - Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (Episode III)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/3977239-014.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) have a long-awaited showdown on the fiery planet Mustafar. Near the end of their fight, Obi-Wan jumps from a platform on a lava river to the safety of the shore. With a tactically superior position, Obi-Wan warns Anakin that the fight is over but his overly confident apprentice tries to jump over the veteran Jedi and gets sliced and diced in the process. Palpatine eventually finds the broken, charred body of Anakin and fits him with his now legendary suit.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>13. Han Solo confronts Kylo Ren - Star Wars: The Force Awakens (Episode VII)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/3977238-013.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>During the rebel attack on Starkiller Base, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) sees an opportunity to speak to his son Ben/Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Solo tries to reason with Ren and attempts to get him to come home. Although seemingly tempted by his father's plea, Ren's decision leads to what may be the most heartbreaking scene in Star Wars history as Han Solo is killed by his own son.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>12. Anakin stops Mace Windu - Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (Episode III)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/3977237-012.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>The Jedi Council discovers that Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is the Sith behind all the chaos in the Republic and confronts him. Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) eventually disarms Palpatine but the two are at a stalemate with Force lightning and lightsabers lighting up the room. Anakin (Hayden Christensen) arrives and must decide who to save. He sides with Palpatine just as Windu is about to strike a killing blow and Anakin's path to the Dark Side is complete.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>11. Lando sells out Han - Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (Episode V)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/3977236-011.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>On the run from the Empire, Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fish), and the crew decide to lay low in Cloud City, which is run by Solo's old friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Unfortunately, they arrive shortly after Darth Vader (James Earl Jones), and Lando is forced to turn on his friend, who ends up frozen in carbonite. Lando more than makes up for his actions, soon becoming a key player in the rebellion.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>10. Qui-Gon defies the Jedi council - Star Wars: The Phantom Menace (Episode I)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/3977235-010.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) believes so strongly that Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) is the one person to bring balance to the Force that even after the Jedi Council rules that the boy is too old to be trained, he says he'll do it anyway. While the matter isn't settled at the time and Jinn is later killed, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) would eventually follow his master's lead and train Anakin as a Jedi.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Queen Amidala's vote of no confidence - Star Wars: The Phantom Menace (Episode I)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/3977234-009.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>With the Trade Federation waging war on her home planet of Naboo, Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) goes to the Galactic Senate for help. Frustrated by a lack of action and egged on by Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), the queen moves for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum (Terence Stamp), putting a leadership change in play. This leads to Palpatine becoming the new chancellor.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Galen Erso sabotages the Death Star - Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/3977233-008.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>An important, albeit reluctant, part of the team that constructed the first Death Star, Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) realizes that he's in a no-win situation. While he doesn't want to make a weapon of mass destruction, he knows the best way to help is by creating a flaw that can destroy it. Erso's storyline in Rogue One also resolves one of Star Wars: A New Hope's most infamous plot holes.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Obi-Wan lets Vader strike him down - Star Wars: A New Hope (Episode IV)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/3977232-007.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) may be an "old fossil" according to Han Solo (Harrison Ford) but the Jedi master plays an important role while trapped on the Death Star. Not only does he disable the tractor beam on the Millennium Falcon but he also diverts Darth Vader's (James Earl Jones) attention so Luke (Mark Hamill), Leia (Carrie Fisher), and their team can escape. Overmatched by his former apprentice and not wanting to get Luke involved, Obi-Wan is struck down and becomes one with the Force. This allows him to continue to guide Luke Skywalker.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. The tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise - Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (Episode III)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/3977231-006.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>During the Star Wars version of a Cirque du Soleil show, Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) summons Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and tells him the story of Darth Plagueis the Wise, a Sith so powerful he could use the Force to create life and keep the ones he cared about from dying. With Anakin's dreams predicting Padme's death in childbirth, this information brings him even closer to the Dark Side.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Order 66 - Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (Episode III)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/3977230-005.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>Once Anakin (Hayden Christensen) becomes Palpatine's (Ian McDiarmid) apprentice, Order 66, a secret order programmed into clone troopers identifying all Jedi as enemies of the Republic, is put into play. With thousands of Jedis eliminated, Palpatine is able to consolidate his power without much resistance.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. The murder of Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru - Star Wars: A New Hope (Episode IV)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/3977229-004.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>While in Obi-Wan Kenobi's (Alec Guinness) hut, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) manages to finally see the entirety of a message hidden in R2-D2 (Kenny Baker). Obi-Wan encourages Luke to go with him to Alderaan and learn the ways of the Force but he refuses, saying there's work to do and that he doesn't want to get involved. However, once Luke returns home and finds the charred remains of his Uncle Owen (Phil Brown) and Aunt Beru (Shelagh Fraser) there's nothing left to keep him on Tatooine and his path as a Jedi begins.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Vader turns on the Emperor - Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (Episode VI)</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1578/15789737/3977228-003.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>After defeating Darth Vader (James Earl Jones) in combat but refusing to kill his father, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) tosses his lightsaber aside, proving he can't be turned. Realizing Luke won't join him, Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) attacks him with Force lightning.

<p><h2>Which Jedi in Clone Wars is your favorite?</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/171/1712892/3639626-ahsoka-and-ventress-in-star-wars-the-clone-wars.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>What's not to love about Star Wars: The Clone Wars? The animated series opened up a whole new side of the Star Wars universe and it is even being kept alive today, thanks to the show's continuation on Disney+ and the upcoming Ahsoka live-action series. So as we celebrate Star Wars Day (May the 4th be with you), we're looking back on the iconic animated series--and specifically its Jedi knights.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the original Star Wars trilogy barely showed us any Jedi knights thanks to their kind being nearly extinct, the prequels gave us a thriving order with knights spread across the galaxy--that is, until their demise at the hands of the clones and the Sith. Star Wars: The Clone Wars did many things right, making us care about the titular clones that fought in the front lines by giving them personalities, deepening our knowledge of the Force by expanding the mythology and adding mystery to it, and making us care about the Jedi and understand that their Order was corrupt and their hubris was always leading to their destruction.</p><p dir="ltr">You can watch all of The Clone Wars--and the just as good, if not better Rebels--on Disney+ right now. If you're looking for even more Star Wars goodness to celebrate May 4, don't worry.

Adi Gallia</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/171/1712892/3639624-10%20adi%20gallia.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr">The Jedi had plenty of great warriors among their ranks, but during the war being skilled with a lightsaber proved insufficient, as other threats started pouring down on the Jedi Council. A skillful negotiator as well as a fighter, Adi Gallia proved very useful in rescue operations when her fellow Jedi got captured in battle, volunteering to rescue Eeth Koth when captured by Grievous, as well as being part of the team that rescued Anakin and Obi-Wan when they infiltrated the Citadel prison.</p><p dir="ltr">Gallia came face to face with General Grievous twice, holding her own, and she had one of the most gruesome and coolest deaths of any Jedi, as Savage Opress gored her with his cranial horns during combat before stabbing her with his saberstaff.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>9. Even Piell</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/171/1712892/3639627-9%20even%20piell.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr"><span>In the years leading up to the introduction of Baby Yoda to the world, many believed Master Even Piell to also be a distant cousin of Master Yoda, as he was seen as part of the Jedi Council in The Phantom Menace and at the victory celebration in Naboo. Of course, we now know for sure that he isn’t, as there is no way Piell was even half as cute as Baby Yoda when he was younger.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Instead, Piell was one of the gruffiest Jedi to serve on the Council, thanks in part to the very tough-looking scar that covers his left eye, and his very thick Russian-like accent. Sadly, Piell has a short appearance on The Clone Wars, appearing in only one episode before being savagely mauled to death by hounds, which is kind of appropriate for this badass Jedi. Before he died, we did get to see him in action, and Piell’s skills with a lightsaber are miles better than Yoda’s, since he’s not just jumping around.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8. Pong Krell</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/171/1712892/3639628-8%20pong%20krell.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">When we meet Pong Krell in The Clone Wars, he already has a reputation for having achieved many victories during the war and for being a skilled tactician. He is an intimidating presence that brings a Colonel Kurtz-type personality to The Clone Wars. In terms of military service during the war, few Jedi come even close to matching Krell’s success in battle.</p><p dir="ltr">Sure, General Krell, unlike Anakin or Obi-Wan, doesn’t really care about his troops and does whatever it takes to win the fight, with more brutal consequences. As we discover in the show, Krell’s success rate comes with high casualties, and a bit of a turn to the Dark Side or two, causing a massacre on his own troops. But also, the guy has four arms and wields two double-bladed lightsabers! He is like two Darth Mauls in one, capable of fighting against dozens of troopers without breaking a sweat! Even if he’s a bit of a sociopath, Krell is a terrifying yet also kind of an inspiring general at a time that required drastic measures from everyone involved. But he also has one of the most visually stunning fighting styles. After all, he has four arms and wields two double-bladed lightsabers!</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Plo Koon</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/171/1712892/3639631-screen%20shot%202020-02-26%20at%203.16.20%20pm.png" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">As wise as Yoda, as skilled as Windu, as approachable as Obi-Wan, and even more level-headed, Plo Koon quickly became a mentor and paternal figure to many young Jedi, even if his mask gives off the impression that he is a criminal mastermind plotting to destroy the entire Order.</p><p dir="ltr">Plo Koon was the one to discover Ahsoka Tano was Force-sensitive, so his contributions to the franchise are bigger than most other Jedi. Though Koon is as good a warrior as any Jedi, he’s more calm and prone to thought over action.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6. Quinlan Vos</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/171/1712892/3639632-6%20quinlan%20vos.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Though Master Quinlan Vos only appeared in a single episode of The Clone Wars, he made a big impression in a short time. Based on the design of a background character in The Phantom Menace and then developed in the Star Wars: Republic comics, George Lucas liked him so much <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/swca-the-untold-clone-wars-panel-liveblog">he added Vos to The Clone Wars</a>, and there was an entire storyline devoted to the character that sadly never made it to the screen before the series was originally cancelled.</p><p>Quinlan Vos is a tough guy who plays by his own rules yet is also very laid-back and could be a fun guy to have at a party. He also has the unique ability to use the force to sense the past of certain objects, making him a skilled tracker (this is the same ability seen in Jedi: Fallen Order). He also harbors a great anger, and even flirted with the dark side <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/everything-we-know-about-the-untold-stories-of-the-clon-1827908786">in the unfinished episodes</a>, which makes you wonder if he and Anakin would get along after finding common ground, or maybe they’d just fight.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5. Tera Sinube</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/171/1712892/3639633-screen%20shot%202020-02-26%20at%203.17.15%20pm.png" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">When you think of a Jedi, you probably think of lightsaber-wielding warriors who fought first and asked questions later. After all, the lightsaber has become synonymous with the word Jedi. But The Clone Wars gave us one Jedi who was as badass as Yoda or Obi-Wan, and who didn’t use a lightsaber for more than a couple of seconds, and also didn’t even serve in combat.</p><p dir="ltr">We refer, of course, to Master Tera Sinube. Less Yoda and more like Master Oogway in Kung Fu Panda mixed with the look of an urRu from The Dark Crystal (stick with me here), Master Sinube worked as an investigator for the Jedi Order because of his deep knowledge of the criminal underworld. It isn’t hard to imagine Master Sinube as a hard-boiled detective back in his prime. He helped Ahsoka find the person who stole her lightsaber, and when the situation asked for it, he still managed to hold his own against an attacker by using his lightsaber--which doubles as a cane! That alone makes him one of the more unique Jedi out there.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Shaak Ti</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/171/1712892/3639636-screen%20shot%202020-02-26%20at%203.18.26%20pm.png" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">One of the most powerful Jedi to ever live, Shaak Ti is sadly best known for her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYRuRLsH8vA">many, many deaths</a> (the character died in several spin-offs of the franchise, but because her scenes were usually cut, writers would simply kill her in a different way next time). In the Expanded Universe, Shaak Ti is extremely proficient with the lightsaber, mastering all fighting forms, and has a very strong connection with the Force.</p><p dir="ltr">When we meet her in The Clone Wars, she is a General in charge of overseeing the creation and training of the Clone Army of the Republic, she is calm but firm, being instrumental in Domino Squad (AKA the best clones in the franchise) finishing their training and graduating. She also came very close to finding the truth about the secret chips inside clone troopers’ brains, but like everyone else, she was deceived by Palpatine.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. Kit Fisto</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/171/1712892/3639638-3%20kit%20fisto.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">There is no single Jedi that can beat Kit Fisto in coolness. From the moment he was introduced in Attack of the Clones during the battle of Geonosis as he was having the time of his life destroying battle droids left and right with a huge smirk, Kit Fisto became a favorite among fans, especially once Clone Wars aired <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeMT-Oki8co&amp;t=42s">this episode</a> that showed the Jedi Master in action in a scenario we hadn’t seen before in the francise, underwater lightsaber fights.</p><p>Fisto was not only like if Aquaman was a Jedi, but was regarded as one of the best duelists in the Jedi Order alongside Mace Windu, and the only one to always bring a killer smile to the battlefront. He was one of the very few Jedi to have not only survived, but even beat Grievous in a fight. Making Fisto even cooler and funnier is the fact that voice actor Phil LaMarr based his voice on 7Up mascot <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/from-concept-to-screen-kit-fisto">Fido Dido</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. Anakin Skywalker</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/171/1712892/3639639-2%20anakin%20skywalker.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">One of the greatest feats the Clone Wars ever achieved was making audiences like Anakin Skywalker, after the damage the prequels did to his image. Where Anakin’s story in the movies was that of a cocky, creepy kid who quickly fell to the dark side, The Clone Wars gave us a true tragic figure you could root for all while understanding why he would be seduced by the dark side.</p><p dir="ltr">Anakin in the show is exceptionally powerful, showing his tremendous skills in battle over and over, and he cares deeply about those he loves, putting the lives of his men and of innocents before his own. But he also harbors great anger and darkness. The Clone Wars showed us over and over why the Jedi Order was not the paramount of morality we (and Anakin) were led to believe, adding to his frustrations with the system, which in addition with his own anger issues made his fall from grace inevitable and tragic. Where most Jedi in the show pretty much stay the same throughout, Anakin (and Ahsoka) are the ones to truly have character arcs, as they grow and evolve throughout the show.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. Ahsoka Tano</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/171/1712892/3639640-1%20ahsoka%20tano.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Was there any doubt that Ahsoka Tano would be number 1? Who would have imagined that The Clone Wars could give us a character we knew obviously couldn’t be a part of the main cast by the end, due to her not being in the prequel movies, have her start out as a character as annoying as Anakin, and see her grow into a true Star Wars icon?</p><p>Even more so than Anakin, The Clone Wars was really the story of Ahsoka. She grew from a peppy padawan full of ideals and over-confidence, into a battle-worn warrior who was as disillusioned with the institutions in power as her master. Her relationship with Anakin became as iconic as that between Luke, Han and Leia, and her decision to leave the Jedi Order after seeing how flawed it was and wanting to carve out a destiny of her own made her one of the most courageous characters in the entire franchise. And it probably saved her life too (although <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/star-wars-rise-of-skywalkers-jedi-voices-heres-eve/2900-3318/">she's clearly dead</a> by the time Rise of Skywalker happens).</p></h3></p><br />

## Xbox Game Pass, The Netflix Of Gaming, Is Struggling To Find Its Big Hits

<p dir="ltr">Xbox's latest splashy exclusive, Redfall, launched this week to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/redfall-review-half-staked/1900-6418062/">disappointing reviews</a> and a collective shrug from many players. Considered a departure from developer Arkane's core strengths of worldbuilding and stealth gameplay, its most confusing flaw is perhaps its lack of identity: Many have opined that it feels like a game that doesn't know what it wants to be.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox's grand gaming strategy is bigger than just one underwhelming exclusive, of course, and the console manufacturer's biggest game of the year is still to come in the form of Starfield. However, Xbox's shaky track record when it comes to big exclusives in recent years has spurred much discussion within the gaming community, with some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/1357fa1/comment/jiihwta/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">Game Pass subscribers</a> wondering what the future of the service might look like. Xbox Game Pass is indeed the current Netflix of gaming, but the service has struggled to find its bonafide hits--its Stranger Things, its Wednesdays, its Dahmers. And when we look in the direction that the major streaming services are currently headed, that spells some interesting decisions for Xbox in the next two to three years.</p><p dir="ltr">You don't have to look far to find people expressing frustration or uncertainty about the future of Xbox's system-sellers. On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/1357fa1/with_a_flop_like_this_what_the_hell_is_next_with/">Xbox Series X</a> subreddit, players cracked wise about next year being "the year" and boss Phil Spencer unveiling "old reliable" in the form of the consistently excellent Forza franchise. And though these are just jokes and memes, there's an undercurrent of exasperation that runs through many of the replies. Some have discussed whether or not Game Pass justifies its monthly cost at this juncture, which is obviously a personal judgment call.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-the-netflix-of-gaming-is-struggling-to-find-its-big-hits/1100-6513805/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>E3 2023 has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-is-canceled/1100-6512853/">canceled</a>, but it was never the only show in town. There are plenty of other high-profile showcases coming this June, so now that it's May, it's about time to start gearing up for some big news and reveals.</p><p>Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest will kick things off on June 8, and the party keeps rolling that weekend with Xbox and Starfield events. These will be followed shortly thereafter by even more showcases, including the PC Gaming Show and Ubisoft Forward. So while E3 2023 is not going forward, the week it was scheduled for will still be quite busy (and hopefully exciting!). Beyond that, June won't be the end of things, as Gamescom takes place in August with its usual Opening Night Live event on August 22.</p><p>And, as usual, we would not be surprised to learn about additional events in the time to come. After all, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-reportedly-coming-within-a-month-bigger-showcase-before-e3/1100-6511413/">PlayStation Showcase is rumored for summer</a> and Nintendo is always a wildcard, so we would never be surprised if the Mario company announces another Direct out of nowhere; last year it hosted a Direct Mini in June. Below you can see the schedule as we know it so far--keep checking back for updates.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-summer-game-fest-2023-press-conferences-schedule/1100-6513776/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>With this week's nationwide release of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 fans will say goodbye to not only James Gunn's tenure at the studio but also Dave Bautista and Zoe Saldaña as Drax and Gamora, respectively. The entire release of the movie has centered around saying goodbyes, but it might not be the last time for a certain cast member.</p><p>"It would be strange to continue [Star-Lord's] story without James," Pratt told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/chris-pratt-return-star-lord-exclusive/">Total Film</a>. "He's done such a masterful job in the first three films. We really found the voice of Peter Quill together and without him, obviously, I would never have had this opportunity. He writes it, he directs it, he dreams up the music, it's his imagination on screen. So, to continue to tell the story, it would really be important to honor what he's done in the first three films and to honor what the fans have grown to love about the character and not simply do it because people might show up to pay for it, you know?"</p><p>Pratt's first outing as Star-Lord/Peter Quill was in 2014's first Guardians movie which was a surprise hit for the studio considering the characters weren't exactly well-known at the time. Now, you can find Star-Lord, Groot, and Rocket Raccoon merchandise next to Spider-Man and Iron Man. Pratt beat out several big-name actors like John Krasinski and Eddie Redmayne to land the role.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chris-pratt-open-to-being-star-lord-without-james-gunn/1100-6513801/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">The first gameplay trailer for upcoming MMO Chrono Odyssey shows off an impressive first look at how the game will play.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier today (May 3) Npixel showed off some gameplay for Chrono Odyssey, its MMO that was first announced in 2020 for  release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Gameplay looks to be real-time action combat, rather than the kind of thing you find in games like Final Fantasy 14 or World of Warcraft where inputs normally have delayed reactions. The trailer mostly focuses on a warrior with a sword-and-shield setup, simply called Swordsman. But it also gives a look at Rangers, Berserksers, and Sorcerers, so it looks like there are plenty of styles to choose from.</p><p dir="ltr">Over on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/03/chrono-odyssey-new-gameplay-details-on-the-upcoming-ps5-mmorpg/">PlayStation Blog</a>, the game's producer Samuel Seo went into more detail about the game, talking about its open-world setting, combat, and more. "Step into the breathtaking world of Setera, an open-world wilderness that transports you to a world that feels ever-changing," said Seo. "Immerse yourself in the stunning scenery which transforms with each passing season, with a realism that captures the essence of a living and breathing environment."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upcoming-mmo-chrono-odyssey-gets-a-super-impressive-first-gameplay-trailer/1100-6513799/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Actress Haley Lu Richardson has revealed she turned down the opportunity to audition for Ari Aster's celebrated horror movie Midsommar, a part that Florence Pugh ultimately landed. Richardson told <a href="https://www.backstage.com/magazine/article/haley-lu-richardson-podcast-interview-76193/">Backstage</a> that Midsommar is one of the roles "that got away."</p><p>The White Lotus Season 2 star said she received the script and the studio wanted to meet her, potentially because she had starred in another eerie movie, M. Night Shyamalan's Split, a couple years earlier. The script for Midsommar was well-written and creepy, Richardson said, but she didn't want to make another "disturbing" movie right away after Split.</p><p>"I was like, 'I don't want to do another disturbing movie right now. I just don't have it in me, going around and crying at these disturbing things.' It wasn’t something that I wanted, and I felt really strongly about that. So I didn't even take the meeting."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/midsommar-could-have-starred-haley-lu-richardson/1100-6513798/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

So his plan was to kill Gamora in 2017's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.</p><p>"I thought she was the one that was going to sacrifice herself, and Quill was going to learn about himself as opposed to in the second movie, and I thought different of it. I was kind of talked out of it by Kevin [Feige] and [Marvel producer Lou D'Esposito], and then it just didn't work that well," Gunn explained.

<p dir="ltr">A new trailer for Pixel Ripped 1978 starring the iconic Atari developer Howard Scott Warshaw sees him diving into the company's very, definitely real history.</p><p dir="ltr">Pixel Ripped 1978 is the latest title in Arvore Immersive Games' VR series that features games within a game, this one pulling from Atari's games and history to tell its story. This latest trailer features Warshaw, who's positively known for designing titles like Yar's Revenge and Raiders of the Lost Ark, and infamously known for E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. In it, Warshaw speaks about a developer who worked at Atari named "Bug," who he notes is "not like a software bug," but "an amazing programmer named Barbara Rivers," who they all called Bug.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">"She's the one who programmed Pixel Ripped," said Warshaw. "It was like she lived in the game. We're trying to make a game, she's coming from out of the game to tell us what she's doing." Bug, of course, isn't actually real, and is a fictional character within the world of Pixel Ripped 1978 who works at Atari. She has to work with Dot--a recurring character in the Pixel Ripped series--to take down the evil Cyblin Lord.

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1595/15950357/4133097-jedisurvivor1.jpeg" /><br /><h3><p>Star Wars Day isn't officially until tomorrow, May 4, but that doesn't mean you have to wait to save big on a wide variety of Star Wars-themed products. Over the years, Star Wars Day has become a sales event that nearly every major retailer participates in, and that's exactly the case for Star Wars Day 2023. Major retailers such as Best Buy and GameStop are already offering an assortment of Star Wars deals. We've rounded up the best Star Wars Day deals so far.</p><p>Not <em>every </em>retailer starts Star Wars Day early, though. There will be new sales going live on May the 4th, so you'll definitely want to check back tomorrow for a new batch of deals. Keep in mind that some of the best Star Wars Day deals will only be available for one day--and they could sell out--so you'll have to be fast if you want to take advantage of some of the most popular offers. Each time we update this roundup, we'll add the new deals to the top, so go ahead and bookmark this page and circle back tomorrow morning.</p><p>In the meantime, you can shop Star Wars deals on Lego sets, replica lightsabers, plushies, Blu-rays, book box sets, video games and accessories, and even an Xbox Series S console bundle. If you're specifically looking for gaming deals, we have a separate roundup dedicated to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-star-wars-day-game-deals-early-discounts-for-ps5-xbox-and-pc/2900-4732/">Star Wars Day game sales</a>. Plus, you can find even more Lego deals in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-early-star-wars-day-lego-deals/2900-4733/">Star Wars Day Lego roundup</a>.</p><p> </p></h3></p><br />

## Destiny 2 7.0.5.2 Patch Notes: Fixes Crucible Glitch, Quest Bugs, Matchmaking

<p dir="ltr">Destiny 2's <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/hotfix_7-0-5-2">latest patch</a> is here, and it includes a number of fixes for bugs both large and small. Perhaps the most significant is a resolved issue that caused players to get suspended from Crucible play as if they quit a match early, though in actuality they did no such thing, which is a real recipe for frustration.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of Crucible, the patch also changes matchmaking of certain modes to a connection-based model. Those models include Clash, Zone Control, and Rift. This will hopefully improve latency and performance around those modes.</p><p dir="ltr">Other fixes include a rare issue that caused players not to be able to complete the Last Will and Testament quest, an issue that caused Orbs of Power to spawn at the wrong place when using the Firepower armor mod, and an exploit that allowed players to dismantle the Guardian Games class item for Legendary Shards and Glimmer. Also, if you're experiencing audio distortion, this patch should hopefully improve that, but the full fix is coming at a later date.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-7-0-5-2-patch-notes-fixes-crucible-glitch-quest-bugs-matchmaking/1100-6513788/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Disney animation veteran Jared Bush has shared an extremely nice and wholesome reaction to The Super Mario Bros. Movie passing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-super-mario-bros-movie-powers-up-past-1-billion-worldwide/1100-6513719/">$1 billion worldwide.</a></p><p>Jared Bush--who was on the writing/directing crews for Encanto, Zootopia, and Moana--said on Twitter that he feels "elated" that the Mario movie is doing so well at the box office. People wrongly assumed that Bush would be angry or upset that a rival film is doing so well. It's not true. A rising tide rising tide lifts all boats, so if more people are interested in animated movies thanks to the Mario film, that's good for the animation movie business overall, Bush said.</p><p>"Love that audiences are turning out in droves for animation. It's great for everyone," Bush said. "I know many people believe animation studios should want to crush each other, but the truth is most of us are all friends, or have worked together, or simply just really respect one another. That's why we love it."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-animation-veteran-has-extremely-wholesome-reaction-to-mario-movie-passing-1-billion/1100-6513785/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
