<p>A tiny BIOS chip lurks inside every computer, sitting on your motherboard to breathe life into your system when you press the power button. It not only powers your PC, but helps protect it, too&mdash;as evidenced by AMD&rsquo;s decision to work with partners to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1801488/amd-issues-bios-patch-to-solve-ryzen-7000x3d-burnout-problem.html">push out critical BIOS updates for AM5 motherboards</a> after new <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiTngvvD5dI&amp;xcust=2-2-516379-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Ryzen 7000 X3D chips started literally (though infrequently) burning out</a>.</p>



<p>BIOS stands for <em>basic input and output system</em>, and the BIOS chip initializes all the other devices in your PC, like the CPU, GPU, and motherboard chipset. But a&nbsp;few years ago, motherboard manufacturers&mdash;in partnership with Microsoft and Intel&mdash;introduced a replacement for traditional BIOS chips dubbed UEFI (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface&amp;xcust=2-2-516379-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</a>).</p>



<p>Almost every motherboard shipping today has a UEFI chip rather than a BIOS chip (UEFI is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3622940/windows-11-system-hardware-requirements.html">a Windows 11 system requirement</a>, in fact), but they both share the same core purpose: preparing the system to boot into the operating system. That said, most people still call the UEFI the &ldquo;BIOS&rdquo; because of the familiarity of the term.</p>



<h2 id="why-you-should-or-shouldnt-update-your-bios">Why you should (or shouldn&rsquo;t) update your BIOS</h2>



<p>Understanding your UEFI is important so you can understand how (and <em>if</em>) to take advantage of the feature updates and bug fixes that come with the BIOS updates offered by motherboard manufacturers.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2017/02/amd-ryzen-1800x-build-7-100711184-orig.jpg"><img alt="amd ryzen 1800x build 7" src="https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2017/02/amd-ryzen-1800x-build-7-100711184-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a><figcaption>
<p>New chip and motherboard platforms often receive numerous BIOS revisions early in their lifecycle, to work out bugs.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>




<p>Your motherboard likely uses whatever firmware revision the motherboard manufacturer was on back when it was built. Over the lifespan of a motherboard, manufacturers release new firmware packages or BIOS updates that will enable support for new processors and memory, or solve commonly reported bugs. For years, the only real reason to update to a newer firmware revision, however, is to solve a bug in your UEFI or to swap in a CPU that&rsquo;s newer than your motherboard.</p>



<p>Some people like to regularly check for and update their UEFI firmware packages just to stay up to date. At one time, this was considered a risky practice, given that the firmware updating process can potentially brick your motherboard in the same way that flashing a custom ROM on to Android phone can brick the device. It&rsquo;s best not to update your UEFI firmware unless there is something specific that the updated firmware offers that you need.</p>



<p>That said, you probably want to stay on top of BIOS updates if you&rsquo;re on a chip or motherboard platform that&rsquo;s fresh out of the gates&mdash;witness those critical BIOS updates for AMD&rsquo;s fresh AM5 motherboard platform mentioned above. Living on the bleeding edge often requires diligence. </p>



<h2 id="how-to-update-your-pc-bios">How to update your PC BIOS</h2>



<p>Make sure you <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407021/best-windows-backup-software.html">back up your critical data</a> before attempting a BIOS update! These updates alter core aspects of your PC and its vital to have backups if anything goes wrong.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2017/03/update-bios-system-info-100712285-orig.jpg"><img alt="update bios system info" src="https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2017/03/update-bios-system-info-100712285-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a></figure></div>




<p><strong>1. Find your current BIOS version:</strong> Before you upgrade your BIOS, make sure you&rsquo;re actually installing a new version. The easiest way to find your BIOS version is to open up the System Information app by typing <strong>msinfo</strong>&nbsp;into the Windows search bar. In the window that opens, your BIOS version should show up on the right, under your processor speed. Record your version number and date, then compare it to the latest version available on your motherboard&rsquo;s support page on the manufacturer&rsquo;s website.</p>



<p><strong>2. Enter the UEFI BIOS:</strong> When you boot up your PC, you&rsquo;ll see text that informs you which button to press to enter the UEFI BIOS. Press it! (The exact button needed, and the design of every motherboard&rsquo;s actual UEFI control panel differs, so these instructions will be more guideposts than step-by-step instructions.)</p>



<p><strong>3. Boot into the UEFI control panel (when possible):</strong> Although not all motherboards offer this feature, on certain models you can boot into the UEFI control panel and use a built-in update utility to connect to the internet and flash the latest firmware from the manufacture&rsquo;s server. This extremely nice feature makes updating to newer firmware revisions as painless as possible.</p>



<p>The process is a bit more involved for motherboards that don&rsquo;t support this feature.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image"><a class="zoom" href="https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2017/03/update-bios-1-100712273-orig.jpg"><img alt="update bios 1" src="https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2017/03/update-bios-1-100712273-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" /></a></figure></div>




<p><strong>4. Find the latest BIOS update from your motherboard&rsquo;s support page:</strong> Go to your motherboard&rsquo;s support page on the manufacturer&rsquo;s website. The latest BIOS update should be in the support and downloads section.</p>



<p><strong>5. Download and unzip the BIOS update file</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>6. Transfer update file onto a USB flash drive</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>7. Reboot your computer into the UEFI control panel</strong></p>



<p><strong>8.</strong> <strong>Launch the UEFI&rsquo;s firmware update tool or flashing tool and back up your PC&rsquo;s existing firmware to your flash drive:</strong> This protects you in case something goes wrong.</p>



<p><strong>9. Use the same UEFI utility to select the new firmware image you saved on the flash drive:</strong> Running the firmware update utility should take just a couple of minutes, but make sure not to shut off your PC during this process. <strong><em>This is critical</em></strong><em>.</em></p>



<p><strong>10. Once the flashing process finishes, restart your computer:</strong> Your updated PC BIOS is ready to rock.</p>



<p>Some manufacturers offer utilities that can update your UEFI chip from directly inside Windows by running an .exe file, but we strongly recommend using one of the two methods above to avoid any problems.</p>



<p>Again, updating your PC&rsquo;s BIOS can provide many benefits, but it&rsquo;s important to understand the risks. Don&rsquo;t touch it if there isn&rsquo;t a clear, compelling reason to update your UEFI firmware. That said, if you want to drop in a newer CPU into an older motherboard, then it&rsquo;s clear that a BIOS update lies in your future.</p>

<p>AMD has now launched the highly anticipated Ryzen 7800X3D, which is a gaming behemoth. It&rsquo;s also &ldquo;smaller&rdquo; in core count than its 7950X3D CPU brother, but still often faster for gaming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This translates perfectly to Mini-ITX performance. You don&rsquo;t need the biggest footprint to be extraordinarily nimble. Gamers are now spoiled with a rich selection of CPUs ranging from the efficient Ryzen non-X CPUs, multicore X variants, and now X3D.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter the Asrock B650E PG-ITX motherboard. At only 6.7&times;6.7 inches, this diminutive, small form-factor contender is anything but weak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It comes packed in the B650E chipset, promising some savings over X670E.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ll go over the features, design, and performance. Does this motherboard contain enough hardware to truly minimize compromise compared to larger-scale motherboards, while performing well? This will all be viewed through the ever-important lens of &ldquo;price to performance,&rdquo; key for an enthusiast-grade offering. It has some drawbacks and positives&mdash;let&rsquo;s find out what they are.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-asrock-b650e-pg-itx-specs">What are the Asrock B650E PG-ITX specs?</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asrock B650E PG-ITX" class="wp-image-1785855" height="836" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-03-29-at-4.48.16-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<ul><li>Mini-ITX form factor (6.7&times;6.7 inches, or 17x17cm)</li><li>Supports AMD AM5 Ryzen 7000 CPUs&nbsp;</li><li>10+2+1 Phase Power Design with 10-layer PCB</li><li>DDR5 RAM, dual channel up to 2 DIMM (up to 64GB)</li><li>2x onboard M.2 slot (Gen 5 and Gen 4)</li><li>1x PCIe 16x slots (PCIe Gen 5)&nbsp;</li><li>HDMI-out plus eDP signal connector&nbsp;</li><li>8 USB ports on back&nbsp;</li><li>Killer 2.5GbE LAN&nbsp;</li><li>Killer Wi-Fi 6E&nbsp;</li><li>2x RGB headers&nbsp;</li><li>2 SATA 6Gb/s ports&nbsp;</li><li>PWM fan headers&nbsp;</li><li>Preinstalled I/O Shield&nbsp;</li><li>Realtek 7.1 ALC 1220 Audio</li><li>MSRP $289</li></ul>



<p>The Asrock B650E PG-ITX comes in at $289, which is right around the middle in terms of pricing for small form-factor offerings. It&rsquo;s cheaper than competing motherboards such as the Asus X670E Strix-I, but still expensive relative to its size.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The B650 chipset will be a slightly cut-down version of X670, but the &ldquo;E&rdquo; gives this motherboard a slight PCIe-lane upgrade. While you&rsquo;re already getting less theoretical USB, SATA, and other ports with B650, Mini-ITX imposes its own limitations due to reduced size.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>You can pair the saucy new Ryzen 7800X3D with this motherboard, or perhaps you&rsquo;d prefer to keep the wattage down and use a non-X variant such as the 7900. Either way, you&rsquo;ll have expansive support here, and we&rsquo;re assuming well into the future with subsequent CPU releases.</p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asrock B650E PG-ITX" class="wp-image-1785856" height="706" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-03-29-at-4.46.40-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Asrock B650E PG-ITX comes with your standard motherboard accessories.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>In the box, you&rsquo;ll get a basic set of accessories such as the Wi-Fi antenna, and some miscellaneous items such as screws. No cool trinkets here like you get with the more expensive motherboards, such as the external sound device with the Asus models. Let&rsquo;s move on to the features and see how they stack up:&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="cpu-choice">CPU choice</h3>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asrock B650E PG-ITX" class="wp-image-1785857" height="848" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-03-29-at-4.48.38-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Asrock B650E PG-ITX offers plenty of choices for the latest Ryzen CPUs.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>This is one area where you&rsquo;ll have plenty of choice. You can pair the saucy new Ryzen 7800X3D with this motherboard, or perhaps you&rsquo;d prefer to keep the wattage down and use a non-X variant such as the 7900. Either way, you&rsquo;ll have expansive support here, and we&rsquo;re assuming well into the future with subsequent CPU releases. CPU cooler compatibility should also shine here, since the socket area isn&rsquo;t as enclosed as you normally find.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="ddr5-ram-and-pcie-gen-5">DDR5 RAM and PCIe Gen 5</h3>



<p>AM5 will be DDR5 RAM only, and Mini-ITX will further limit you to only two sticks, with 64GB total of RAM. While it still supports fast speeds, you&rsquo;ll have less capacity here due to the size.&nbsp;</p>



<p>B650 &ldquo;E&rdquo; means that you&rsquo;ll have a nice little extra allotment of PCIe Gen 5 to share with the M.2 drive. The 16x PCIe Gen 5 slot will be for your GPU, and then the other M.2 slot will be PCIe Gen 4.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="storage">Storage</h3>



<p>As expected, you&rsquo;ll only get two onboard NVMe slots due to the Mini-ITX form factor. This is typically fine for gaming builds of this caliber, although we&rsquo;d love to see a third offered. SATA is also limited, with only two SATA ports&mdash;but once again, should fulfill the need of most gamers with small enclosures.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="usb-ports">USB ports</h3>



<p>With eight rear USB ports, you have a good quantity of ports. Disappointingly, four of these USB ports are only 2.0, which is a bit of a miss on a motherboard of this price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HDMI- and eDP 1.4-out is also here to take advantage of Ryzen&rsquo;s built-in iGPU function for your display when needed.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="networking">Networking</h3>



<p>Networking is standard fare, with Killer&rsquo;s 2.5GbE Lan standard, along with Killer&rsquo;s Wi-Fi 6E. This is now the expected suite of networking on modern motherboards, and it&rsquo;s great to see even smaller form-factor designs including these without compromise.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>



<p>Audio is good, with a 7.1 ALC 1220 codec. You will also have some inputs in the back, which will suffice for most users. Optical is here too, which can be great for those connecting external audio devices such as certain speakers.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="other-features-of-note">Other features of note</h3>



<p>The integrated I/O shield is here, which we love. Captive screws for the M.2 are also a good touch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are a few &ldquo;misses&rdquo; here, however. No BIOS flashback button, a feature that many cheaper motherboards are now including. You&rsquo;ll also notice the large M.2 fan as a dominant feature, but it can be noisy if not properly adjusted and is perhaps superfluous. Most motherboards do fine with thermal pads only. It&rsquo;s also missing a debug LED, a feature some may find useful.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="asrock-b650e-pg-itx-design">Asrock B650E PG-ITX design&nbsp;</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asrock B650E PG-ITX" class="wp-image-1785860" height="870" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-03-29-at-4.48.08-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p></p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>The Asrock B650E PG-ITX motherboard is an adorable motherboard&mdash;until you see that rather peculiar M.2 fan area. While you may mistake it for something more akin to a VRM heatsink, it&rsquo;s meant to cool the M.2 drive. You can remove it if you want or if it interferes with your PC&rsquo;s interior aesthetic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Otherwise, it&rsquo;s a straightforward Mini-ITX design. You&rsquo;ll have the colorful accents on the I/O area, but not much in the way of RGB. That&rsquo;s fine&mdash;most small form-factor builds are a bit cramped and tend to block access to the visuals. You still have RGB headers for some extra pizazz when needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One nice plus of the design is the positioning of the VRM heatsink. Together with the overall more open sides, this makes installing larger CPU coolers much easier. Some small form-factor motherboards tend to be very closed in, making some larger coolers impossible to fit. That&rsquo;s a good design element here that benefits the user.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The protruding M.2 fan design aside, the M.2 drives will be safely tucked away and should remain cool. The rear of the I/O area has some nice colorful outlines of the USB ports, along with patterned design. The rest of the motherboard is basic, with the usual DDR5 RAM area mostly for utility. The top is likewise sparse, with most of the visual action happening to the left side of the CPU with the VRM heatsink and I/O area.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asrock B650E PG-ITX" class="wp-image-1785861" height="696" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-03-29-at-4.47.17-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Asrock B650E PG-ITX (backside).</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thiago Trevisan</p></div>



<p>Going around to the back, it&rsquo;s mostly standard fare with a little bit of extra support here. While you&rsquo;ll never see the backside frequently, it&rsquo;s nice to know that the materials and overall finish of the entire motherboard generally feel pretty good.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="asrock-b650e-pg-itx-performance-software-and-bios">Asrock B650E PG-ITX performance, software, and BIOS&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The Asrock B650E PG-ITX motherboard includes a very capable 10+2+1 power phase with 105 amps. It may not appear as impressive on paper as larger ATX motherboards, but this is more than adequate for even the fastest Ryzen CPUs. It also packs a 10-layer PCB design&mdash;which is more than many offerings. This solidifies the connections and gives you higher-quality componentry. You&rsquo;ll likely be more limited by the actual CPU cooler in a small form-factor build than by VRM temperatures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can expect performance here to be almost on par with higher-end motherboards since you&rsquo;ll have access to the same fast CPUs and DDR5 RAM.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DDR5 is also mandatory on AM5&mdash;but with Mini-ITX motherboards, you&rsquo;ll typically get only two DIMM slots. This limits you to 64GB of RAM&mdash;which is sufficient for any gaming build or even light workstation scenarios.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PCIe Gen 5 support is impressive on such a small motherboard. You&rsquo;ll get the GPU slot at 16x Gen 5, plus an M.2 Gen 5 slot. While Gen 5 components are just barely coming out now, you&rsquo;ll have more than enough future-proofing here to upgrade later when the technology is more widespread. You&rsquo;ll also get a  second Gen 4 NVMe slot, boosting your onboard capacity.</p>



<p>Other performance aspects of the I/O are a bit of a miss&mdash;namely the USB ports. While you do get eight of them, you won&rsquo;t find any USB4 or a large selection of faster USB 3.0 ports.&nbsp;You get too many of the older USB 2.0&mdash;which, while fine for peripherals, certainly should be upgraded on a motherboard of this price. At least you do get some faster USB 3.0 ports, so it&rsquo;s not all bad news.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To further tweak performance, we have the Asrock BIOS. It&rsquo;s mostly improved from years past, and you&rsquo;ll find most of the usual RAM and CPU tweaking options here. While you may not want to break any records with a Mini-ITX motherboard such as this, it will certainly have some overclocking headroom depending on your cooling gear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most users will be fine just setting the AMD &ldquo;Expo&rdquo; DDR5 RAM profile for your kit, and possibly some auto-overclocking such as AMD &ldquo;PBO&rdquo; (Performance Boost Overdrive).</p>



<p>Asrock also offers software in Windows, like many motherboard vendors. It even offers overclocking with the &ldquo;Blazing OC Tuner,&rdquo; which can adapt the overclock based on use. While a neat idea, we typically recommend avoiding these types of automatic-overclocking pieces of software, as it can sometimes open a can of worms with stability issues if anything changes. It&rsquo;s likely to just be a safer bet to stick to the traditional in-BIOS tweaks for any modification that you can manually adjust if needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&rsquo;ll also get Asrock&rsquo;s motherboard utility software and Polychrome RGB. These allow you to adjust your RGB header colors, and other useful items for adjusting options without using BIOS. An auto-driver installer will find your drivers&mdash;such as the network items&mdash;so you can have an easier time upon initial setup.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Asrock B650E PG-ITX" class="wp-image-1785862" height="484" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-07-at-1.21.21-PM.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Asrock Blazing OC Tuner for CPU Overclocking.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Asrock</p></div>



<p>We&rsquo;d recommend more frequent BIOS updates for B650E than usual, since it&rsquo;s a new platform and bugs get squished a lot more often early on. Some users may experience longer than normal boot times, which certain other AM5 motherboards have also experienced. Overall, it&rsquo;s a decent showing on the software side for those who want to dabble with the utility they provide.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="is-the-asrock-b650e-pg-itx-worth-it">Is the Asrock B650E PG-ITX worth it?</h2>



<p>The Asrock B650E PG-ITX is a fine small form-factor motherboard, with a few limitations. AM5 started off as an expensive platform for gamers, and it&rsquo;s slowly improving with cheaper DDR5 pricing, along with some cost savings with the B650 chipset in lieu of the pricier X670.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mini-ITX has some limitations right off the bat, such as RAM capacity limited to 64GB, and less &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; onboard. That&rsquo;s no fault of the Asrock B650E PG-ITX, of course. It does skimp in a few areas, however&mdash;such as USB 2.0. The M.2 fan is also a dubious choice, likely unnecessary, and adds to the bulk (and to the noise, too&mdash;unless you adjust the fan curve).&nbsp;</p>



<p>While $289 MSRP is cheaper than some higher-end offerings in the small-motherboard space, it&rsquo;s still a bit on the expensive side. We&rsquo;d love to see more robust features for that price&mdash;as it stands now, it&rsquo;s just &ldquo;enough&rdquo; (i.e, not an overachiever).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, gamers will be happy with the ability to pack fast DDR5 RAM and blazing Ryzen CPUs such as the 7800X3D in such a small unit. It&rsquo;s also capable with modern tech like a PCIe Gen 5 16x slot and NVMe support. The B650 &ldquo;E&rdquo; gives it that extra PCIe Gen 5 boost over regular B650.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;It has enough features for most gamers to be happy, and those seeking more will have to pay a bit more for another option.</p>

<p>Buckle up, friends: This is the cheapest I&rsquo;ve personally seen a 2TB NVMe SSD selling for <em>ever</em>. Amazon is selling the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZQ97H3W?th=1&amp;xcust=2-2-1804197-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">2TB Silicon Power Gen3 SSD for just $75</a>. Remember when an SSD going for 10 cents per gigabyte were considered an outstanding value? Well, this works out to about four cents a gig.</p>



<p>Giggity!</p>



<p>Silicon Power&rsquo;s drive won&rsquo;t break any performance records. It uses the older PCIe 3.0 interface (we&rsquo;re up to PCIe 5 now) and is one of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/784380/host-memory-buffer-hmb-the-dram-less-nvme-technology-thats-making-ssds-cheaper.html">new breed of &ldquo;Host Memory Buffer&rdquo; SSDs</a> ditching onboard DRAM to help drive prices downward. (It sure worked here.) All that said, this triple-layer cell drive will boot into Windows and run your games and applications with the blazing-fast speeds SSDs are beloved for. You shouldn&rsquo;t use it with a PlayStation 5 as that doesn&rsquo;t support HMB technology, and it&rsquo;ll be slower than newer-gen drives if you&rsquo;re frequently performing large file transfers, but if you simply want a big, fast SSD to store your PC games and files, this is an absolutely astonishing deal.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not the only one either. If you need an SSD with DRAM to run on a PS5, B&amp;H Photo is selling a <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1635040-REG/intel_ssdpeknu020tzx1_2tb_670p_ssd_m_2.html?BI=21883&amp;KBID=28249" rel="nofollow">2TB Intel 670p SSD for $80</a>. Pick your poison&mdash;but don&rsquo;t miss out. These jaw-dropping deals are exceptional ways to drastically expand your storage without breaking your budget. <em>Four cents per gig</em>. Sheesh.</p>

## A folding phone likely won’t replace my PC, but I want to try it

<p>I like PCs. I spend most of my days writing about them. (Or at least, something related to them). But I also like light, portable devices and these twin interests led me to purchase a Diamond Mako once upon a time.</p>



<p>Back in the era of the personal digital assistant (PDA), you only had two real choices for mobile computing: a big notebook or an even bigger laptop. If you needed a device that doubled as a blunt trauma weapon (or means to improve your stamina while tromping to and from classes), you were living in the right era.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, PDAs served as rudimentary proto-smartphones, and they weren&rsquo;t cheap. They didn&rsquo;t do much either&mdash;not compared to today&rsquo;s iPhones and Android devices. But that Mako. It had a large screen (remember, this was the early 2000s), a compact keyboard (perhaps the smallest 65 percent board in existence), and a <em>touch screen</em>. More importantly, you could actually edit documents and spreadsheets on it, in addition to more basic PDA functions. I loved that thing and used it until I finally saved enough for an ultra lightweight laptop (a Dell Latitude X200, if you&rsquo;re curious).&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Are you in the market for a lightweight laptop? If so, you should check out our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/917881/best-2-in-1-laptops.html">best 2-in-1 laptops available right now</a>.</p></blockquote>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Screenshot of the Diamond Mako on the Obsolete Computer Museum website" class="wp-image-1802700" height="550" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/diamond-mako-2.png" width="629" /><figcaption><p>The Diamond Mako, as seen on the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.obsoletecomputermuseum.org/diamondmako/&amp;xcust=2-2-1802658-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Obsolete Computer Museum</a> website. Look at that keyboard! That touch screen! The only real drawback was the lack of backlighting on the display. Oh, and the battery. Gosh, I miss it.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>Since then, I haven&rsquo;t really looked back. I actually sold the Mako, too, thinking that it deserved to live out the remainder of its life in service rather than moldering in my desk drawer.</p>



<p>But the trend of folding smartphones has stirred up that dormant part of my brain, and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to quiet down until I finally get some extended time with one. Whether that&rsquo;s one of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/834888/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review.html&amp;xcust=2-2-1802658-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Fold models</a> or the rumored <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.extremetech.com/mobile/latest-pixel-fold-leaks-leave-little-for-google-to-reveal&amp;xcust=2-2-1802658-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Google Pixel Fold</a>, I&rsquo;m wondering how well I could use one as a PC substitute.</p>



<p>This part of my brain is active in spite of my own experience. I know better than most people that a phone is not a PC. More specifically, I know that you can&rsquo;t transform a phone into a substitute for a desktop PC&mdash;software like Bixby isn&rsquo;t quite the same. I&rsquo;ve also spent hours trying to determine if I could easily force mobile devices into acting like a full computer: Perhaps I could find a way to root a tablet and put Windows for Arm processors onto it? Maybe I&rsquo;d overlooked a modern phone or tablet running an x86 processor? Could it be possible to use Linux or ChromeOS? (The answer to all those questions: No).</p>



<p>But I love the idea of being able to pull out a single device from a jacket pocket, flipping it open to a larger screen, pulling an ultra compact keyboard from my bag, and comfortably diving into writing an article on the fly, as well as tweaking the accompanying images. Then after I&rsquo;m done, folding it back up and using it like a regular phone&mdash;a juiced up, modern take on the experience I had on my Mako. I can kind of do that now on my current smartphone, but the screen is small and my eyes aren&rsquo;t what they used to be.</p>



<p>Will the reality be seamless and easy? Probably not. But I&rsquo;m jazzed to try. Maybe chalk it up to nostalgia, but the idea of tempering expectations because of device limitations doesn&rsquo;t bother me. When I held that fancy PDA in my hands twenty years ago, I only saw possibility. I see that again now.</p>



<p>When I finally get to run this experiment, I&rsquo;ll let you know how it goes.</p>

<p>Spring is here and that means weeding, cleaning, packing away winter clothes&hellip; and tuning up your PC! Optimizing your PC&rsquo;s performance isn&rsquo;t as complicated as it sounds, however. Just a few tweaks here and there and you&rsquo;ll have your PC running faster than ever.</p>



<p>Improving your PC&rsquo;s efficiency can take a little effort, though some processes can be automated. Your PC is like a Roomba in that streamlining your laptop or desktop often happens when you&rsquo;re not looking. Below, we&rsquo;ve listed several ways to improve the responsiveness and overall speed of your PC and to preserve its longevity, too. Some may be familiar, others not. And if you&rsquo;ve already taken care of these, good for you!</p>

<h2 id="1-apply-windows-updates">1.) Apply Windows updates</h2>



<p><em>Have you tried turning it off and on yet? </em>The U.K.&rsquo;s <em>The IT Crowd </em>made this a meme and it&rsquo;s true. Rebooting can in fact make a wonky PC behave. From experience, though, PCs can also behave badly when an update is needed or downloaded but not yet installed.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Windows Update" class="wp-image-1794751" height="787" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/windows-11-windows-update.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Applying the latest Windows  update is a must, whether it be automatically or manually.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Make sure your PC is up to date via Windows Update (open the <em>Settings</em> menu, then <em>Windows Update</em> and click &ldquo;check for updates&rdquo;). <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402720/how-to-manage-windows-10-updates.html">Manage Windows updates</a> to make them less of a pain. Apply <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/626322/update-chrome-and-edge-right-now-to-protect-against-a-zero-day-exploit.html">updates to Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge</a>, and other browsers by checking them. The Microsoft Store app is the front door for applying updates to Windows apps like Mail or Calendar, though those will happen in the background.  Make sure Windows Defender or any anti-malware apps you use are also current, though that should happen automatically.</p>



<p>One additional tip: go to <em>Windows Update &gt; Advanced options</em> and toggle on the option for updating &ldquo;other Microsoft products&rdquo;. That can actually trigger updates for products connected to your PC, like a Brother printer.</p>



<h2 id="2-update-your-router-to-secure-your-home">2.) Update your router to secure your home</h2>



<p>You need to make sure all of your software drivers are updated. Most of this happens automatically, though, as part of your day-to-day use. </p>



<p>A major exception is the software used by your router, which often requires specifically accessing the router or the accompanying app. If you&rsquo;re <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/695032/how-to-fix-wifi-router-issues.html">having problems with your Wi-Fi</a>, this can help.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Netgear Orbi RBK760 review Orbi app for Android" class="wp-image-1781545" height="823" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Netgear-Orbi-RBK760-Android-app.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>You don&rsquo;t even need a PC to manage a router&rsquo;s fimrware any more.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Thomas Newton / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Make this a habit. It&rsquo;s unlikely that your suburban neighbors are trying to hack your PC. In an urban apartment, however, there are likely numerous people within Wi-Fi range that come and go. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/624825/update-your-asus-wi-fi-routers-firmware-right-away.html">Botnets love to hack Wi-Fi routers</a>, too. Just play it safe, open your router&rsquo;s app, and update the firmware. </p>



<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad time to update your password, either&mdash;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394029/how-to-create-strong-secure-passwords.html">passwords get easier to crack</a> all the time. Forgot your router&rsquo;s password? It&rsquo;s really not the worst thing to just write it on the bottom of the device, especially if you live alone. (If someone breaks in, this is the least of your worries). Otherwise, make sure you trust your roommates.</p>



<h2 id="3-adjust-your-pcs-performance-slider">3.) Adjust your PC&rsquo;s performance slider</h2>



<p>It&rsquo;s an old trick, but a simple one. Yes, your PC has a bona fide turbo button and you can adjust it however you&rsquo;d like. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 performance slider" class="wp-image-1794736" height="892" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Windows-11-performance-slider.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Windows literally allows you to dial up your PC&rsquo;s performance!</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Windows has a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407245/speed-up-windows-tips-for-a-faster-pc.html">performance slider in Windows 10</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394854/how-to-turn-on-power-mode-in-windows-11-for-increased-performance.html">one in Windows 11</a>, which you can use to literally tell your PC to run faster. It may lower your laptop&rsquo;s battery life a bit, if you&rsquo;re on the go. But using either the Windows controls or any associated utilities that shipped with your GPU or gaming laptop can also be used to accomplish the same thing: click a button, get a faster PC.</p>



<h2 id="4-uninstall-old-or-unnecessary-programs">4.) Uninstall old or unnecessary programs</h2>



<p>One of the benefits to owning a PC is trying out various applications and services. Sometimes, however, you&rsquo;ll discover that you might not need them any more, perhaps because they&rsquo;ve become less useful. So, remove them!</p>



<p>First, view your installed apps. The easiest way to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/560844/how-to-uninstall-programs-in-windows-11.html">uninstall an app in Windows 11</a> is to go to your Start menu and review the list of applications. To uninstall a program, right-click the app. Alternatively, you can use the Windows Settings menu (<em>Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Installed apps</em>, or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/422778/how-to-uninstall-programs-and-apps-in-windows-10.html"><em>Apps &amp; Features</em> in Windows 10</a>) and review which applications you have installed. To uninstall an app, simply click the ellipsis (&hellip;) menu to the right of the app. Windows will tell you how much disk space it takes up and how much you&rsquo;ll get back by uninstalling it.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 installed apps" class="wp-image-1794737" height="643" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Windows-11-see-all-apps.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Apps can take up just a few megabytes, or gigabytes, too. Manage them in the Settings menu.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>That&rsquo;s not a perfect solution, though. In some cases, you may have Win32 apps installed&mdash;utilities or games, mainly. A game launcher like Steam will tell which games Steam installed on your PC, giving you the option to uninstall them. Alternatively, you can also use the old-school Control Panel for a list of installed apps. Go to <em>Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Programs and Features</em>, click the game, and uninstall it. </p>



<p>Which files should you uninstall? It&rsquo;s probably safe to say that if you&rsquo;re unsure about it, leave it. But if it&rsquo;s an app that you simply don&rsquo;t have any need for, get rid of it. Feel free to use a search engine to learn more about individual entries. And note the <em>size</em> of the program, too&mdash;eliminating the biggest ones make the most sense.</p>



<h2 id="5-check-and-see-if-your-hard-drive-ssd-is-full">5.) Check and see if your hard drive/SSD is full</h2>



<p>This is a simple tip, but a useful one. Open up File Explorer and navigate to My PC. Check to see how full your primary boot disk is. If the file gauge is in the red, you have about 10 to 15 percent of the drive remaining to store files. Not only will this prevent you from installing large games or video files, a clogged drive can also slow down your PC if there&rsquo;s not enough available space for use with background processes. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="Windows File Explorer drive size" class="wp-image-1794739" height="696" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/File-Explorer-drive-size.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>This PC&rsquo;s SSD is filling up, but there&rsquo;s still room left for now.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>What you don&rsquo;t have to do is worry about defragging your hard drive or SSD. Windows handles all of that quietly and in the background.</p>



<h2 id="6-eliminate-massive-files-by-backing-up-then-deleting">6.) Eliminate massive files by backing up, then deleting</h2>



<p>Generally speaking, the bulkiest files on your SSD or hard disk will be programs (generally games, which we hope we just cleaned up) as well as big files like video. You probably don&rsquo;t need to harken back to the days of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/482004/nine_absurdly_useful_file_management_utilities.html">extensive file management utilities</a> we wrote about a decade ago, though apps like <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/&amp;xcust=2-1-1793414-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Space Sniffer</a> remain to find large, hidden files. Your best bet is to simply identify the largest video and/or music files and move them off of your PC. Here, you&rsquo;ll want to dig through File Explorer, specifically Your PC: Videos, Music, Documents, and Pictures. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 File Explorer videos" class="wp-image-1794744" height="802" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Windows-11-video-list.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Windows  11&rsquo;s File Explorer is your key to finding big files. You can also organize by size using the drop-down menu above.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>If you&rsquo;d like, you can <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/426736/3-easy-steps-anyone-can-take-now-to-back-up-a-pc.html">back up files to a backup hard drive or the cloud via our Windows backup guide</a>. (Or why not both? Here are our recommendations for the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407021/best-windows-backup-software.html">best Windows backup software</a>, and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html">best external drives</a> for doing so). Alternatively, OneDrive is a solid choice for cloud backup, offering up to 1TB of cloud file storage via Microsoft 365. Other alternatives are OneDrive, Box, Dropbox, or Google Drive, all of which will allow you to create a dedicated backup folder within File Explorer for file backup. </p>



<p>OneDrive allows you to automatically back up files stored in Documents and the Pictures folder as well as your Desktop. Click the OneDrive icon on your taskbar, then the Settings gear in the flyout menu to manage this.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not quite as simple as it should be, though. If you use your desktop as a place to store random files, you might want to turn off OneDrive&rsquo;s Desktop backup to save space. Apps like games or Adobe can also use your Documents folder to save games or backup files, which you might need backed up into the cloud.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 OneDrive backup arrow" class="wp-image-1794748" height="1200" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Windows-11-OneDrive-backup-arrow.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1141" width="1141" /><figcaption>Windows has built-in backup capabilities that can be launched by clicking the OneDrive icon on the taskbar, but they must be managed.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>In a case where OneDrive syncs a specific folder, cloud files (indicated by the small cloud icon next to it) are mixed in with local files. Personally, this makes me a little nervous&mdash;in a folder whose contents are backed up to the cloud, deleting the file erases it from your local drive as well as the cloud. (It then goes to the Recycle Bin, where it can be restored). To avoid this, you can use File Explorer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Free up space&rdquo; command by making local files cloud-only, deleting the local copy and letting the file live online instead. </p>



<p>The bottom line is this: Root out big files, back them up, double-check, then delete the originals from your PC.</p>



<h2 id="7-turn-on-storage-sense">7.) Turn on Storage Sense</h2>



<p>Some of those big, SSD-eating files can actually be temporary backups, data files, and the like, hidden deep within your PC. Don&rsquo;t bother managing this yourself. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393199/how-to-get-rid-of-old-files-and-clean-up-your-pc-with-windows-storage-settings.html">Storage Sense does it for you</a>. This feature eliminates temp backups, deletes old files in the Recycle Bin, and removes local files from your PC <em>if</em> they&rsquo;ve been backed up online. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Windows 11 free up storage screenshots" class="wp-image-1504299" height="824" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/windows-11-storage-sense-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="920" /><figcaption>Storage Sense can handle a lot of your PC&rsquo;s cleanup tasks, automated  and in the background.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Anyron Copeman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>I usually trust Storage Sense to make the smart decisions here, although I always turn off the option to delete files in my Downloads folder. </p>



<h2 id="8-disable-unwanted-startup-programs-for-improved-performance">8.) Disable unwanted startup programs for improved performance</h2>



<p>These suggestions will clean up your hard disk. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/918588/how-to-disable-windows-startup-programs-fast-boot-speed.html">Blocking apps from loading themselves during the boot process</a>, however, will speed boot times and help reduce the strain on your computer&rsquo;s RAM or memory. </p>



<p>Programs want to helpfully load themselves into memory to be available right away! But that&rsquo;s really not necessary in all cases. Simply launching the program will do all that, costing you a spare second or two. (The exception are some security programs like antimalware, which should always run beginning at startup).</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 startup apps" class="wp-image-1794749" height="725" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Windows-11-startup-apps.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>You don&rsquo;t need as many apps as you think when  booting up your PC.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>The Windows Settings menu (<em>Apps &gt; Startup</em>) allow you to toggle apps on and off at startup, along with a broad generalization of what effect that will have on your PC.  Again, the rule of thumb is if you don&rsquo;t know, leave the app on. Feel free to research it, though. If it&rsquo;s entertainment related, you can probably turn it off.</p>



<h2 id="9-eliminate-browser-plug-ins-you-dont-use">9.) Eliminate browser plug-ins you don&rsquo;t use</h2>



<p>We all spend a lot of time on the Web, and your browser is like your PC. If you&rsquo;re using plug-ins and add-ons that you don&rsquo;t need, either disable them or remove them entirely. By doing so, you&rsquo;ll reduce the amount of memory your browser consumes, which will then improve your PC&rsquo;s overall performance.</p>



<p>In Google Chrome, open the menu with three vertical dots in upper right-hand corner. Scroll down to <em>More tools</em>, then <em>Extensions.</em> Remove or disable anything you don&rsquo;t need. </p>



<p>In Microsoft Edge, click the ellipsis menu (three dots, horizontally) and navigate down to <em>Extensions</em>. That will open a small popup window where you can remove unwanted extensions.</p>

<p>Take an additional step and review which sites also have access to your digital credentials.  It can be quite handy to use your Microsoft ID or your Google identity to log on to a new site or service, but there&rsquo;s no reason to let them have access to your personal information if you don&rsquo;t need to.

</div>


<p>Most laptops are an exercise in compromise&mdash;but what if you need a laptop that can handle a bit of everything? The Lenovo Slim Pro 7 is an alluring option. It combines the latest AMD Ryzen processors with Nvidia graphics yet maintains a slim, portable profile and even scores respectable battery life.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>For more options, check out our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.html">best laptops available today</a>.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="lenovo-slim-pro-7-specs-and-features">Lenovo Slim Pro 7: Specs and features</h2>



<p>The Lenovo Slim Pro 7 is powered by AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 7735HS processor, an eight-core, sixteen-thread chip <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444850/amd-launches-mobile-ryzen-7000-cpus-prepping-for-an-ai-future.html">which uses the Zen 3+ architecture</a>. It&rsquo;s paired with Nvidia RTX 3050 graphics, promising a one-two punch of CPU and GPU performance.</p>



<ul><li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 7735HS</li><li>Memory: 16GB LPDDR5</li><li>Graphics/GPU: Nvidia RTX 3050 6GB</li><li>Display: 14.5-inch 2560 x 1600 IPS 90Hz</li><li>Storage: 512GB PCIe Gen4 SSD</li><li>Webcam: 1080 with IR&nbsp;</li><li>Connectivity: 1x USB4 40 Gbps with DisplayPort 1.4 and Power Delivery, 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 with DisplayPort 1.4 and Power Delivery, 1x USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, 1x HDMI, 1x 3.5mm combo audio</li><li>Networking: WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.1</li><li>Biometrics: Windows Hello Facial Recognition</li><li>Battery capacity: 73 watt-hours</li><li>Dimensions: 12.81 inches x 8.92 inches x 0.71 inches</li><li>Weight: 3.5 pounds</li><li>MSRP: $1,199</li></ul>



<p>Lenovo&rsquo;s pricing is competitive, slapping this configuration with a $1,199 MSRP (at Best Buy). It&rsquo;s among the least expensive laptops available with this hardware: some Dell Inspiron, Acer Swift, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1531369/msi-sword-15-a12ue-review.html">MSI Sword</a> models undercut it on price, but they have older AMD Ryzen 5000/6000 or 12th-gen Intel Core i7 processors.</p>



<h2 id="lenovo-slim-pro-7-design-and-build-quality">Lenovo Slim Pro 7: Design and build quality</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Slim build quality" class="wp-image-1797712" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/lenovo-slim-pro-7-2023-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Lenovo has quietly established itself as a leader in modern laptop design over the past decade, and the Lenovo Slim Pro 7 benefits from this experience. It&rsquo;s a simple but elegant laptop that makes all the right decisions. Material quality is high, with metal panels across all touch points, and the &ldquo;storm grey&rdquo; colorway looks excellent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Slim Pro 7 lives up to its name with thin display bezels and a svelte chassis that measures just .71 inches thick and weighs only 3.5 pounds. It&rsquo;s just a shade larger than the Apple MacBook Pro 14, which is .61 inches thick and also weighs 3.5 pounds. The Lenovo has a slightly larger 14.5-inch display, so it&rsquo;s also a few tenths of an inch wider than the Mac.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What&rsquo;s the catch? Well&hellip;there isn&rsquo;t one. The laptop&rsquo;s only oddity is a lip on the top display bezel that&rsquo;s used to house the 1080p webcam. It might catch on objects when you slip the laptop in or out of a bag but also makes the laptop a tad easier to open. There&rsquo;s otherwise nothing to complain about. The Slim Pro 7 is a functional, attractive laptop that can go toe-to-toe with Dell&rsquo;s XPS and Apple&rsquo;s MacBook Pro.</p>



<h2 id="lenovo-slim-pro-7-keyboard-trackpad-pen">Lenovo Slim Pro 7: Keyboard, trackpad, pen</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Slim keyboard and trackpad" class="wp-image-1797714" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/lenovo-slim-pro-7-2023-4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>I suspect Lenovo has hired a few warlocks, as there&rsquo;s some black magic lurking in the company&rsquo;s keyboards. The Slim Pro 7&rsquo;s thin chassis offers little room for key travel, yet key feel is excellent thanks to a lengthy, crisp key action. It&rsquo;s an unquestionable improvement over current Dell XPS, Razer Blade, and Apple MacBook Pro laptops, and comparable to the redesigned keyboard found on the most recent MacBook Air.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A white keyboard backlight is included and offers three brightness settings: low, high, and automatic (which selectively turns on the backlight based on ambient light). The backlight does the job but is otherwise unremarkable, and I would like to see more brightness options. Low might seem too bright in a very dark room and high is too dim to see in brighter settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The touchpad is large, measuring nearly six inches wide and three inches deep. This is comparable to the Apple MacBook Pro 14, Razer Blade 14, and Dell XPS 15. The touchpad is smooth and Windows&rsquo; multi-touch gestures are easy to use thanks to the touchpad&rsquo;s ample size and sensitivity.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="lenovo-slim-pro-7-display-audio">Lenovo Slim Pro 7: Display, audio</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Slim Pro 7 hero" class="wp-image-1797673" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/lenovo-slim-pro-7-2023-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Lenovo provides a 14.5-inch IPS touchscreen with 2,560 x 1,600 resolution in most Slim Pro 7 models (a 3,072 x 1,920 IPS touchscreen is available as an upgrade). It offers passable performance but scores noticeably behind the Mini-LED in Apple&rsquo;s MacBook Pro 14 and Windows laptops with OLED displays such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1442835/acer-swift-edge-review.html">Acer Swift Edge</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1486723/samsung-reveals-galaxy-book3-oled-laptops.html">Samsung Galaxy Book3</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/631211/lenovo-yoga-9i-review-the-pinnacle-of-design.html">Lenovo Yoga 9i</a>.</p>



<p>The display reached a mediocre maximum contrast ratio of 1140:1. That&rsquo;s acceptable but behind similarly priced alternatives like the Microsoft Surface Laptop 5. Apple&rsquo;s MacBook Pro 14 with Mini-LED display can hit a contrast ratio of 6680:1 and laptops with an OLED display, such as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1677692/lenovo-yoga-9i-review-2.html">Lenovo Yoga 9i</a>, perform better still. The Slim Pro 7&rsquo;s low contrast ratio can lead to a washed-out and flat look, though I only found this noticeable when using the laptop in a dark room.</p>



<p>Brightness isn&rsquo;t great with a maximum luminance of 364 nits. That&rsquo;s about the same as the Microsoft Surface Laptop 5 but generally behind similarly priced laptops, which achieve 400 to 600 nits. Color gamut is also modest, reaching 99 percent of sRGB and 82 percent of DCI-P3. Alternatives with an OLED display, including the Yoga 9i, cover the entire sRGB color gamut and up to 99 percent of DCI-P3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not all bad news. The 14.5-inch display&rsquo;s 2,560 x 1,600 resolution packs 208 pixels per inch, which is superior to a 27-inch 4K monitor. Text looks crisp and high-resolution content appears realistic and detailed. The refresh rate is boosted to 90Hz, as well, providing a slight boost to motion smoothness and clarity.</p>



<p>A pair of upward-firing speakers sit on either side of the keyboard and provide clear, crisp sound. Maximum volume is high enough to fill a small room with music and a hint of low end provides depth to music and movies. Better speakers can be found in a handful of laptops, including the Apple MacBook Pro 14, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/538948/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-review.html">Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio</a>, and Lenovo Yoga 9i, but the Slim Pro 7&rsquo;s audio is solid for a slim laptop.</p>



<h2 id="lenovo-slim-pro-7-webcam-microphone-biometrics">Lenovo Slim Pro 7: Webcam, microphone, biometrics</h2>



<p>A 1080p webcam is stuffed in a small camera hump on the Lenovo Slim Pro 7&rsquo;s top display bezel. Video quality is great for a laptop webcam with acceptable sharpness and color reproduction. Uneven lightning can cause issues with exposure and the image will appear grainy in low light, but this is true of any laptop webcam.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The webcam is paired with an IR camera that enables support for Windows Hello facial recognition login. It&rsquo;s fast, seamless, and easy to use. Lenovo offers an automatic user detection feature that, when enabled, will automatically bring the laptop out of sleep and use Windows Hello to log you in. It&rsquo;s a small but convenient addition.</p>



<p>Audio is captured with a quad-microphone array that provides strong volume and good clarity. The included noise canceling was extremely effective in my testing, removing the sound of a space heater and mostly obscuring soft music played from a nearby speaker.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="lenovo-slim-pro-7-connectivity">Lenovo Slim Pro 7: Connectivity</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Slim connectivity" class="wp-image-1797729" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/lenovo-slim-pro-7-2023-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>A healthy range of connectivity lines the Lenovo Slim Pro 7&rsquo;s flanks. It includes a USB4 port capable of up to 40 Gbps of data as well as Power Delivery and DisplayPort 1.4. This is joined by a second USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port which also handles Power Delivery and DisplayPort 1.4. Both ports can be used to charge the laptop or connect a monitor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The laptop also has a USB-A port, an HDMI port, and a 3.5mm combo audio port, providing a good range of connectivity for older devices. An SDcard reader is absent, however, and sorely missed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wireless connectivity is solid with support for Bluetooth 5.1 and the latest Wi-Fi 6E standard. A Wi-Fi 6E router is required to unlock the benefits of this new standard, but Wi-Fi 6 performance was also reliable, reaching 80 Mbps in a detached office several walls and fifty feet away from a router.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="lenovo-slim-pro-7-performance">Lenovo Slim Pro 7: Performance</h2>



<p>The Lenovo Slim Pro 7 packs AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen 7735HS, an eight-core, sixteen-thread processor with a maximum clock speed of 4.75GHz. This makes for an interesting comparison with Lenovo&rsquo;s own Yoga 9i Gen 8, which is similar in size and weight but packs Intel&rsquo;s Core i7-1360P.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Slim PCMark 10" class="wp-image-1797735" height="754" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/lenovo-yoga-slim-pro-7-pcmark10.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>PCMark 10 produced a favorable score of 6,585. This places the Lenovo Slim Pro 7 ahead of not only the Yoga 9i Gen 8 but other comparable laptops such as the Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 and HP Dragonfly Pro. The Slim Pro 7&rsquo;s strong score in this benchmark indicates strong performance in a variety of situations, a result that&rsquo;s born out in other benchmark tests.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Slim Cinebench R15" class="wp-image-1797740" height="736" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/lenovo-yoga-slim-pro-7-cinebench-r15.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Cinebench R15, a heavily multithreaded processor benchmark with a short duration, notches a clear win for the Slim Pro 7 and AMD Ryzen 7735HS. The Ryzen screams past the Intel Core i7-1360P to a score of 1,938, a roughly 20 percent improvement over Intel&rsquo;s alternative.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Slim Handbrake" class="wp-image-1797743" height="749" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/lenovo-yoga-slim-pro-7-handbrake.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Handbrake, another demanding multithreaded processor test, reinforces the strength of the Ryzen 7735HS. It buzzed through our video encoding test file in just 1,298 seconds, notching another win over the Intel Core i7-1360P.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Lenovo Slim Pro 7 pairs AMD&rsquo;s capable Ryzen processor with Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 6GB mobile graphics. Power usage is constrained to a mere 63 watts, but the discrete graphics chip provides a massive leap over integrated graphics.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Slim 3DMark Time Spy" class="wp-image-1798308" height="759" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/lenovo-yoga-slim-pro-7-3dmark-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>3DMark&rsquo;s Time Spy test turned in a result of 4,733, which is more than twice as quick as the Intel Iris Xe integrated graphics in the Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro 360 and Lenovo Yoga 9i. It also handily beats the AMD Radeon 680M integrated graphics in the HP Dragonfly Pro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also fired up a couple games to see how this incarnation of the RTX 3050 handles popular titles. <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> averaged a solid 65 frames per second at 1080p resolution and Highest detail. That result is just a tad slower than the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1529835/msi-katana-gf66-review.html">MSI Katana GF66</a>, a budget gaming laptop with Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti mobile graphics. The <em>Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker</em> benchmark reached a score of 10,884 and the game averaged between 60 and 90 frames per second in real-world gameplay at 1080p and High detail.</p>



<p>The Lenovo Slim Pro 7 delivers excellent performance across a wide range of tasks, which is impressive given its affordable price. This laptop is a good pick for most content creators, students, casual gamers, and anyone else seeking an affordable do-it-all laptop.</p>



<h2 id="lenovo-slim-pro-7-battery-life">Lenovo Slim Pro 7: Battery life</h2>



<p>Every Lenovo Slim Pro 7 ships with a 73 watt-hour battery. That&rsquo;s a modest size for a 14.5-inch laptop but delivered good battery life results in our testing. AMD&rsquo;s efficient Ryzen 7735HS led the laptop to 13 hours and 12 minutes of endurance in a standard video loop, scoring yet another win over the Intel Core i7-1360P in Lenovo&rsquo;s Yoga 9i.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Lenovo Slim battery life" class="wp-image-1797756" height="778" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/lenovo-yoga-slim-pro-7-battery-life.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG / Matthew Smith</p></div>



<p>Lenovo achieves solid battery life through switchable graphics, a feature that deactivates the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 when its performance isn&rsquo;t required and falls back on the more efficient, integrated AMD Radeon 680M.</p>



<p>Be warned that the laptop&rsquo;s battery life may fall short of this test result if the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 is in use. Battery life could be reduced to just a couple hours in a demanding 3D game, and apps that sneakily activate the RTX 3050 can bring down battery life. Fortunately, the switchable graphics feature proved smart in my time with the laptop, and I didn&rsquo;t notice an excess drain on the battery in my day-to-day use.</p>



<h2 id="lenovo-slim-pro-7-conclusion">Lenovo Slim Pro 7: Conclusion</h2>



<p>The Lenovo Slim Pro 7 is an attractive, portable laptop that&rsquo;s ideal if you need a combination of CPU and GPU performance. It also nails the fundamentals with solid connectivity, an enjoyable keyboard, a large touchpad, and top-notch webcam. Display quality is a weakness, but it&rsquo;s an acceptable compromise for the laptop&rsquo;s extremely competitive $1,199 MSRP.&nbsp; The Slim Pro 7 is a versatile, affordable laptop and hard to beat for the price.&nbsp;</p>
