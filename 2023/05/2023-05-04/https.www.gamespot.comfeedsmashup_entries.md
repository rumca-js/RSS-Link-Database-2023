<p> </p><p dir="ltr">Starting with Avengers: Endgame back in 2019, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has told a bunch of different "end of an era" stories. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is the latest of these, with a number of the main cast members publicly declaring that this is the last MCU film they're doing--and writer/director James Gunn has taken over as boss over at rival DC Studios, so he probably won't be making any more Marvel movies in the near future.</p><p dir="ltr">So, yeah, after three of their own movies, two Avengers movies, a Thor movie, and a holiday special, this is the end of the road for this specific Guardians of the Galaxy roster. The group itself will continue to exist one way or another, however, and it wouldn't be all that shocking to see a new iteration of the group pop up down the road.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-ending-and-post-credits-scenes-explained/1100-6513842/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2's Older Raid Exotics Will Soon Be Easier To Obtain

<p dir="ltr">A welcome recent change in Destiny 2 has seen the addition of raid and dungeon Triumphs that increase the likelihood of getting the random Exotic weapons associated with those activities. In other words, completing optional objectives makes it more likely that you'll obtain the very rare, highly desirable Exotics as you repeat those raids and dungeons. But this is only true for a select number of those activities, something that will be changing in the upcoming Season of the Deep.</p><p dir="ltr">The Exotics from five more raids will soon have Triumphs that boost your personal drop rate. This is only for randomly dropped Exotics, but notably, these boosts will be attached to existing Triumphs. These are retroactive, meaning if you've already completed the Triumphs in question, you'll immediately have the boosted drop rate.</p><p dir="ltr">This applies to <strong>One Thousand Voices</strong> (the fusion rifle from Last Wish), <strong>Eyes of Tomorrow</strong> (the rocket launcher from Deepstone Crypt), <strong>Collective Obligation</strong> (the pulse rifle from Vow of the Disciple), <strong>Vex Mythoclast</strong> (the fusion rifle from Vault of Glass), and <strong>Touch of Malice</strong> (the scout rifle from Kingsfall).</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-older-raid-exotics-will-soon-be-easier-to-obtain/1100-6513860/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2's New Strand Aspects Revealed For Hunters, Titans, And Warlocks

<p dir="ltr">Aspects are a key part of each subclass in Destiny 2, but so far, there has been no choice in terms of what to use while playing Strand. That changes in the upcoming Season 21, Season of the Deep, as Bungie has now revealed the new Aspect that each class will receive.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie has previously said it would be expanding the array of Aspects next season, but outside of revealing the names of each one, it had offered no details on what they would entail. In the latest <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny-2-g-games-23-twab">This Week at Bungie</a> post, it explained, "Our goal with these Aspects is to strengthen the existing Strand kits and expand the gameplay options of each class."</p><p dir="ltr">The new Hunter Strand Aspect is <strong>Threaded Specter</strong>. Activating your class ability leaves behind a decoy that attracts enemy fire, providing you and your team with an opportunity to seek out cover. When enemies get close to the decoy or destroy it (something that requires "significant damage,"), it explodes, dealing damage and summoning Threadlings.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-new-strand-aspects-revealed-for-hunters-titans-and-warlocks/1100-6513859/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

The Strong Museum said Barbie Fashion Designer is notable because it showed that games designed for girls could succeed in a market that, at the time, was geared toward boys and men. Computer Space, meanwhile, is a cabinet black-and-white game where players control a spaceship fighting against enemy saucers. It was groundbreaking at the time.</p><p>The Last of Us is Naughty Dog's celebrated PS3 game that went on to spawn a sequel and the HBO TV series most recently. It's regarded as a masterpiece by many.

The art may show a glimpse of that enemy, as Titan is known to be home to some sort of enormous being in the depths of its seas. We also see what certainly appears to be Sloane, Titan's vendor and a key story character who has also been MIA since Titan went missing.

## Sean Bean Reveals His Favorite On-Screen Death, And It's A Good One

<p>When actor Sean Bean shows up in a movie, it's understood that his character is probably going to die. In a new interview with <a href="https://screenrant.com/sean-bean-death-onscreen-first-dying-trend-comments/">ScreenRant</a>, Bean discussed this phenomenon and revealed which on-screen death is his favorite from over the years.</p><p>Bean played Boromir in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings series, and his character had a very memorable death scene in The Fellowship of the Ring.

## Guardians of the Galaxy's Pom Klementieff Loved Playing A Mission: Impossible Baddie As Much As Playing Mantis

<p>While "Who's the strongest Avenger?" will always be up for discussion, there's not much question about which member of the Guardians of the Galaxy is the nicest. Really, Mantis is the only one of them who's even nice at all. She's said more nice things in her time with the group than the rest of them combined.</p><p dir="ltr">So it's funny, then, that Mantis actor Pom Klementieff's other big role this summer is in Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wild-mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-cinemacon-footage-shows-surprisingly-funny-car-chase/1100-6513667/">a murderous bad guy who gunned down a bunch of people in the CinemaCon footage we saw last week</a>. As Klementieff told GameSpot at the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 junket, these two couldn't be any more different.</p><p dir="ltr">"They're the polar opposite of each character," Klementieff said. "It's really fun to get to see two sides of, you know, what I can do."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guardians-of-the-galaxys-pom-klementieff-loved-playing-a-mission-impossible-baddie-as-much-as-playing-mantis/1100-6513847/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Knowing The Future Can Still Doom You In Harmony: The Fall Of Reverie

<p>Harmony: The Fall of Reverie is the latest choice-driven narrative adventure game from developer Don't Nod, the studio responsible for the likes of Life is Strange, Tell Me Why, and Vampyr. This time around, the crux of each decision impacts the outcome of two separate worlds, meaning it feels like there's twice as much to consider. It's a lot of responsibility, and the game helps you along by giving you the gift of prophecy, allowing you to see glimpses of the branching timelines of fate in an effort to avoid undesirable outcomes. And yet, despite this apparent advantage, the game does a marvelous job of surprising you with unforeseen outcomes of your choices anyway, curating an experience that can feel more akin to the sinking sensation of Greek tragedy than anything else. My sick little twisted heart really digs it so far.</p><p dir="ltr">In The Fall of Reverie, you play as Polly, returning to your hometown in search of your mother, who disappeared weeks prior. The once-popular but small corporation MK has ballooned in the time you've been away, controlling most aspects of the community by having a hand in almost every commercial commodity, owning the police, and surveilling the population via drones, cameras, and social media accounts.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">That's not the only surprise in store for Polly, however. Upon arriving home, she discovers a strange necklace that transports her to Reverie, the realm of the god-like Aspirations. The Aspirations--Bliss, Power, Bond, Truth, Chaos, and Glory--inform Polly that she is now the Aspiration known as Harmony like her mother was before her. Using her new gift of clairvoyance, she must guide Reverie back toward balance. Failing to do so will end both the Aspirations and humanity.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/knowing-the-future-can-still-doom-you-in-harmony-the-fall-of-reverie/1100-6513850/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Kevin Feige Says Guardians Of The Galaxy Movies Succeeded "Entirely Because Of James Gunn"

<p dir="ltr">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is the end of the road for a lot of the gang, with most of the main cast saying they're done with the MCU after this movie. Likewise, writer/director James Gunn, who has shepherded the Guardian of the Galaxy series from the start, is already co-boss of rival DC Studios--he's not going to be making any more Marvel movies while he holds that job. Even so, Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige had nothing but love for Gunn at the film's press conference with the cast ahead of the movie's release.</p><p dir="ltr">"What has this trilogy impressed upon you? Working with James, seeing his vision, watching this come to fruition and the fans reaction, what are you learning?" asked moderator Nathan Fillion, who also had a supporting role in Guardians 3.</p><p dir="ltr">"You know, we've had trilogies before. We've had a number of them, actually. And I was thinking, 'Why does this feel so different and so much of a passage of some sort?'" Feige reflected on the stage. "And it's because Guardians really was the first movie that was completely outside of the realm. It tied in with Thanos and Infinity Stones. But The Avengers were not in it. And we weren't setting up Tony Stark's next adventure, or Captain America.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kevin-feige-says-guardians-of-the-galaxy-movies-succeeded-entirely-because-of-james-gunn/1100-6513846/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Tons Of Apex Legends Bugs Were Caused By A Single Line Of Code

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a> has endured its fair share of bugs in the four years since its initial release, and the most stubborn, persistent issues with the game seem to be sound-related bugs. But the game's audio woes may have finally come to an end, as Respawn says it has found the source of the problem: a single line of code related to a new weapon that was introduced to the game at the start of<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-16-start-date-changes-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6511163/"> Season 16</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In the game, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-nemesis-weapon-guide/1100-6511169/">Nemesis</a> is an energy assault rifle with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-new-weapon-nemesis-was-stolen-from-rampart/1100-6511558/">a curious origin</a>. In real life, however, it's apparently been the catalyst behind many of the game's sound effect issues. But audio bugs weren't the only issues lurking behind the new firearm--the introduction of the Nemesis caused dozens of bugs to pop up, including one that caused grenades to disappear.</p><p dir="ltr">Describing the ordeal as "finding a needle in a haystack," Respawn developers explained the source of the issues in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/136t6ta/dev_team_update_audio_update/">Reddit post</a> earlier this week. Interestingly, they weren't even trying to address problems with the game's sound effects when they discovered the problem--they were just trying to fix the disappearing grenades, which led developers down a "rabbit hole" revealing the two bugs were caused by one source: a single line of code that was added to the game when the Nemesis debuted.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tons-of-apex-legends-bugs-were-caused-by-a-single-line-of-code/1100-6513858/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">AMC is set to launch a new spinoff series of its popular show, The Walking Dead, titled The Walking Dead: Dead City, on June 18. In a new teaser trailer exclusively released by <a href="https://ew.com/tv/walking-dead-dead-city-teaser-maggie-vs-negan-clash/">Entertainment Weekly</a>, we finally get a first glimpse into what to expect.</p><p dir="ltr">The new show features Lauren Cohan's character, Maggie, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan's character, Negan. Speculation has been high about whether they'd be working together or fighting against each other. Well, wonder no longer, as the teaser depicts a scene in which Maggie runs over Negan with her truck, followed by a battle between the two, with Negan using a wrench and Maggie wielding a large knife. This scene contrasts with their previous encounter in the series finale where they ended things with a truce. Maggie had invited Negan to stay, but he respectfully declined.</p><figure><div class="image-gallery__label">Gallery</div>   <div class="image-gallery__list hide-scrollbar">       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1600/16003485/4133805-twd_816_gp_1116_0136_rt.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 1" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1600/16003485/4133805-twd_816_gp_1116_0136_rt.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1600/16003485/4133806-twddc_100_pk_0720_00621-rt.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 2" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1600/16003485/4133806-twddc_100_pk_0720_00621-rt.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1600/16003485/4133807-twddc_100_pk_0722_01085-rt.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 3" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1600/16003485/4133807-twddc_100_pk_0722_01085-rt.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1600/16003485/4133808-twddc_100_pk_0725_0164-rt.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 4" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1600/16003485/4133808-twddc_100_pk_0725_0164-rt.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1600/16003485/4133809-twddc_100_pk_0802_0547-rt.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 5" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1600/16003485/4133809-twddc_100_pk_0802_0547-rt.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1600/16003485/4133810-twddc_100_pk_0804_0105-rt.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 6" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1600/16003485/4133810-twddc_100_pk_0804_0105-rt.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1600/16003485/4133811-twddc_100_pk_0808_0348-rt.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 7" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1600/16003485/4133811-twddc_100_pk_0808_0348-rt.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1600/16003485/4133812-twddc_100_pk_0808_0595-rt.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 8" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1600/16003485/4133812-twddc_100_pk_0808_0595-rt.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1600/16003485/4133813-twddc_100_pk_0810_0308-rt.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 9" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1600/16003485/4133813-twddc_100_pk_0810_0308-rt.jpg" />     </a>   </div>  </figure><p dir="ltr">Although it appears the truce is has been invalidated, Maggie needs Negan's help, and they embark on a journey to Manhattan, where Maggie has a plan.

<p>The upcoming car racing movie Fast X races to theaters later this month, but you don't have to wait until then to get into the action. A free tie-in game is available now on your phone or browser.</p><p>The game has a silly name befitting the silly series, Fast X: The End of the Road Begins, and you can <a href="https://letsrace.fastxmovie.com/">boot it up right here right now.</a> Before getting into it, though, the game plays some footage from Fast X, because this is first and foremost a marketing ploy. The game itself is an 8-bit-style racing game where you move left and right to dodge cars and other obstacles on the road with the end of goal of reaching the finish line as fast as possible. Special items give you a speed boost and there are some excellent soundbites, too, like "game recognizes game."</p><div>          </div><p>There are multiple courses to get through, set in the different parts of the world where the movie takes place like Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro, and Rome.

<p>It's Star Wars Day, and if you're looking to <em>really </em>flex how strong you are in the financial Force, then Hot Toys is all too happy to oblige. Like previous years, the Hong Kong-based toy manufacturer has a few new figures in development, which it showed off today. Inspired by The Clone Wars TV series, you can now <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.sideshow.com/collectibles/star-wars-darth-sidious-hot-toys-912312">preorder your very own Darth Sidious</a> </span> and <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.sideshow.com/collectibles/star-wars-clone-commander-fox-hot-toys-912313">Clone Trooper Commander Fox</a> </span> for your collection, with each one of these highly detailed action figures coming with its own selection of accessories.</p><p>For Darth Sidious--who bears a striking resemblance to Chancellor Palpatine--you get the Sith Lord in all his Order 66 glory. He features a newly developed head sculpt and a separate rolling eyeballs system--just like your accountant when you tell them of this purchase--a finely tailored outfit, dual lightsabers, sculpted hands with Force lightning effects, and a themed figure base. Like other Star Wars figures from Hot Toys, the lightsabers light up and come with interchangeable blades to simulate the effect of them being in motion.</p><figure style="width: 1666px;"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4133771-344552911_1300493784216870_3044446344147419238_n.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4133771-344552911_1300493784216870_3044446344147419238_n.jpg" /></a></figure><figure><div class="image-gallery__label">Gallery</div>   <div class="image-gallery__list hide-scrollbar">       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4133772-344158787_563986055848598_660664230162252089_n.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 1" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4133772-344158787_563986055848598_660664230162252089_n.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4133773-344754196_542292241409718_1645887536400501090_n.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 2" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4133773-344754196_542292241409718_1645887536400501090_n.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4133774-344806190_1296444017882505_744533514801425475_n.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 3" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4133774-344806190_1296444017882505_744533514801425475_n.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4133775-344820474_1218888975492547_1371017825797185371_n.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 4" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4133775-344820474_1218888975492547_1371017825797185371_n.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4133776-344839155_249421024262423_2374054793382144061_n.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 5" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4133776-344839155_249421024262423_2374054793382144061_n.jpg" />     </a>       <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4133777-344873809_551828803799517_8973656520940242575_n.jpg">       <img alt="Gallery image 6" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4133777-344873809_551828803799517_8973656520940242575_n.jpg" />     </a>   </div>  </figure><div><div class="norewrite" title="">           <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.sideshow.com/collectibles/star-wars-darth-sidious-hot-toys-912312">Preorder at Sideshow Collectibles</a> </div></div><hr /><p> </p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hot-toys-celebrates-star-wars-day-with-new-and-expensive-clone-wars-figures/1100-6513835/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>What's worse than being trapped in a World War I bunker that's sorely in need of an electrician to help fix the lights? The exact same bunker, only it happens to be inhabited by murderous creatures who are looking to lethally bump you off in the dark. That's just what you'll see in this new extended gameplay trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/amnesia-the-bunker/">Amnesia: The Bunker</a>--and can't <em>unsee</em>--as the video provides an in-depth look at the game's dynamic and immersive methods for staying alive. Like referencing the creatures in the dark with spicy language.</p><div>          </div><p>Developed by Frictional Games, the studio behind cult-classic horror games such as 2010's Amnesia: The Dark Descent and 2015's SOMA, Amnesia: The Bunker takes place in a semi-open world. Frictional Games is aiming to make this latest chapter in the Amnesia series more replayable, and some of the more interesting gameplay mechanics include a crafting system and several randomization elements for each playthrough.</p><p>"In embracing this more choice-driven form of progression, the experience of playing The Bunker oftentimes feels a bit more frantic than Amnesia: The Dark Descent or Amnesia: Rebirth--at least in those games, you always knew you were on the right track if you kept moving forward," Jordan Ramée wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amnesia-the-bunker-is-too-stressful-for-me-but-an-interesting-shift-away-from-the-series-linear-roots/1100-6512881/">Amnesia: The Bunker preview</a>.

<p>Bandai Namco and Supermassive Games announced that The Dark Pictures Anthology: Man of Medan is now available on Nintendo Switch.</p><p>The most interesting aspect of this Switch port is that its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/the-dark-pictures-anthology-man-of-medan-switch/">Nintendo eShop page</a> specifically states that the game runs at 24fps. Most games usually run at 30fps or 60fps, so having Man of Medan on Switch running at 24fps is unusual. This port also retains the same features found on other platforms, such as the Curator’s Cut game mode, two-player online and five-player couch co-op multiplayer modes, and accessibility options such as subtitle and difficulty settings.</p><p>One new feature that this version has is an extended playable chapter called Flooded, which introduces new character deaths during the game's ending.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-dark-pictures-anthology-man-of-medan-on-nintendo-switch-runs-at-24fps/1100-6513833/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-star-wars-day-deals-available-now/2900-4735/">Star Wars Day </a>means a lot of things to a lot of people, and for PC gamers, it means adding to a backlog of games that will never be completed. For this year's celebration, Fanatical is holding a <span class="norewrite">           <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100770772-13797872?sid=subid_value&amp;url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/franchises/star-wars">Star Wars sale</a> </span> with big discounts on dozens of games from multiple generations. Ranging from ye olde classic MS-DOS era to PS2 ports, CD-ROM hits to more modern entries in the franchise, there's bound to be a Star Wars game on Fanatical that either hits you right in the nostalgia bones or reminds you that you haven't played <em>that </em>game yet.</p><p>For example, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is still a brilliant game more than a decade later and has everything that you could want from a Star Wars experience. A charismatic lead, plenty of action, and a story that charted the rise of the Rebel Alliance between the prequel and original film trilogies. Or at least it did until Disney Death Star-lasered it out of continuity.</p><p>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic has stood the test of time and is still arguably Star Wars at its storytelling best, Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast is a prime example of why the Jedi Order should have reconsidered its stance on laser blasters, and Republic Commando will remind you that Sev is still waiting to be rescued by Delta Squad.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fanaticals-star-wars-day-sale-features-beloved-pc-games-for-cheap/1100-6513832/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has commented on the battle between Microsoft and rivals Sony and Nintendo, saying Xbox sits in third place and the idea that Microsoft could just make better games to gain marketshare doesn't hold up. Spencer said even if Starfield is the best game in the history of the world, that wouldn't be enough to help Xbox overtake PlayStation.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKwfEQ1eEyM">Kinda Funny</a>, Spencer said Microsoft's goal is not to "out-console" Sony or Nintendo in terms of sales. Unfortunately for Microsoft, it lost the sales race in the Xbox One/PS4 generation, and the company has no hope of making it back to No. 1 by console sales alone, Spencer said.</p><div>          </div><p>"We are not in the business of out-consoling Sony or out-consoling Nintendo. There isn't really a great solution or win for us. And I know that will upset a ton of people. But the truth of the matter is that when you're third place in a console marketplace and the top two players are as strong as they are and in certain cases have a discrete focus on doing deals and other things that will--that make being Xbox hard for us as a team--our vision is everyone on console has a great experience and they feel like a first-class citizen," Spencer said.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-no-world-where-starfield-is-so-good-people-sell-their-ps5-and-move-to-xbox-phil-spencer-says/1100-6513821/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The galaxy of Star Wars can easily fit onto a table, judging by the number of board games available right now, and for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-star-wars-day-deals-available-now/2900-4735/">Star Wars Day</a>, many of those tabletop experiences are currently on sale. If you're looking to roll the dice and take on the Empire, then there's no shortage of great games that'll let you live out your Jedi fantasy or defy the odds as a galactic rogue. Just remember, never tell us what the odds are when we're playing these games.</p><p>For Star Wars fans who want to mix some Warhammer 40K into one of their favorite sci-fi franchises, check out Star Wars Legion. This tabletop game focuses on infantry battles between the Rebel Alliance and the Empire, and it comes with an army of miniature figures that you can spend a cathartic weekend painting.

<p>Singer-songwriter-actress Miley Cyrus voiced the character Mainframe in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, but she will not return for the trilogy-capper hitting theaters on May 5.</p><p>Tara Strong, a veteran voice actor from TV and video games, will voice Mainframe in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, <a href="https://collider.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-3-mainframe-recast/">according to Collider</a>. Strong herself <a href="https://twitter.com/tarastrong/status/1653949690831044609">seemingly confirmed the news on Twitter.</a></p><p>Cyrus played Mainframe, an AI without a body, in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. If you didn't know that, it's understandable given that Mainframe only appeared in a very brief post-credits scene. In any event, fans might have believed that Marvel had more in store for Cyrus in the MCU, but that was not to be. Strong is taking over the role for Vol. 3 and potentially beyond if Mainframe has any other MCU appearances lined up for the future.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/miley-cyruss-role-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy-recast-for-part-3/1100-6513820/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Discord Is Making Everyone Pick New Usernames This Year

<p>It's the end of an era for Discord usernames, as the social platform is ditching the four-digit tag that it puts at the end of those handles. As noted by Discord, this change will result in every single one of its users needing to choose a new username, with each unique handle being marked by an "@" symbol, similar to Twitter. Naturally, this is very bad news for anyone named John but good news for the first person to claim "@John" when the changes go live.</p><p>"The whole point of these changes is that we want to make it a lot easier for you and all the new users coming to Discord to connect and hang out with friends," Discord co-founder Stanislav Vishnevskiy wrote in a <a href="https://discord.com/blog/usernames">blog post</a>. "We know that your username and identity are important, and we understand that some of you may not like this change and disagree with it. We also recognize that our current username format has been one of the things that makes Discord unique, and that this change makes our usernames look a lot like those on other platforms. To be blunt, that's kind of the point. These weren't easy decisions, and we didn't come to them lightly."</p><p>Vishnevskiy added that current usernames are "often be too complicated or obscure for people to remember" and share easily, while the four digits that came after a name resulted in unexpected limitations. For example, "Mike" is a common online name, which is great for the 9,999 Mikes on Discord already, but meant that the thousands of <em>other </em>Mikes had to settle for a different username.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discord-is-making-everyone-pick-new-usernames-this-year/1100-6513818/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Destiny 2's Best Supers Are Getting Big Upgrades In Season 21

<p>Abilities are back in the spotlight in Destiny 2, as Bungie plans to fine-tune Guardian powers for Season 21 of the game. Every subclass will be getting tweaked, with Supers being a primary point of attention. Bungie had previously spoken about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-gets-more-accessibility-improvements-in-season-of-the-deep/1100-6513418/">increasing the effectiveness of roaming Supers</a> in particular, and next season, the developer is aiming to put them on a more level playing field when compared to other Supers.</p><p>"One of the ways we're working to increase that viability is through damage resistance," <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/s21_abilities_tuning">Bungie explained</a>. "In addition to the damage resistance values that Supers have against other players, all Supers have additional intrinsic damage resistance against PvE combatants, which we're increasing. With this change, our goal is that Supers--in particular melee Supers--are more easily able to engage with targets in high-difficulty content."</p><p>Players will benefit from a 20% increase to damage resistance in PvE while a roaming Super is active, and more nuanced changes will be implemented across all three Guardian subclasses. For Hunters, Golden Gun, Arc Staff, and Spectral Blades will be getting big boosts that will increase their damage, do a better job at debuffing enemies, and deliver a more lethal payoff for accurate attacks.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-best-supers-are-getting-big-upgrades-in-season-21/1100-6513817/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
