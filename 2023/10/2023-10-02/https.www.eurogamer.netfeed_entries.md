Sergiy Galyonkin, director of publishing strategy at Epic Games - and creator of Steam analytics website Steam Spy - has announced his departure from the Fortnite maker after nearly eight years, saying he is "not a good fit" for the "new version of Epic".
</p><p>
Galyonkin's career in the games industry spans more than two decades but he gained renown after establishing Steam Spy in 2015, a project he continued to run after joining Epic as Eastern European head of publishng in 2016. A year later, Galyonkin became the company's director of publishing strategy, with a specific focus on Epic's store, and he's remained in that role since. 
</p><p>
Now, though, Galyonkin has revealed his time at the company is over. "Today is officially my last day at Epic Games," he wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/galyonkin/status/1708836762

Six games are set to leave Xbox Game Pass in the next two weeks, including Trek to Yomi. 
</p><p>
Want to know more about Trek to Yomi? Well, let me quickly samurai-se it for you. In Trek to Yomi, which is set in Japan during the Edo period, players take on the role of a young warrior named Hiroki. Hiroki will have to face the "forces of evil" as he tries to make amends for failing to protect his village from a brutal onslaught.
</p><p>
The Black-and-white samurai curio is set to leave the service on 16th October, so if you were interested in taking up your sword and having a go for yourself, but hadn't managed to get round to it yet, this is a little reminder to snap it up while you can.

It could have been anything. But it's not; it's familiar. We're still building a Victorian-style city in the snow, and it still looks very cold out there. Look more closely, though, and there are some surprisingly profound differences underneath.</p><p>The biggest immediate change is that the weather - the extreme cold - is no longer your major concern in the game.

Sunless Sea developer Failbetter Games has reached a "mutually agreeable settlement" with Alexis Kennedy, the company's founder and former creative director, following years of public feuding and legal threats.

## EA Sports FC 24 second-biggest UK boxed game launch this year

EA Sports FC 24 is the second-biggest boxed game launch of 2023 here in the UK, though physical sales are down by 30 percent on last year's FIFA 23.
</p><p>
The rebranded FIFA bumped boxed game juggernaut Hogwarts Legacy into third place in terms of the biggest 2023 UK physical game launches. Only The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has sold more. 
</p><p>
While boxed sales are declining across the board, annual mass market titans FIFA and Call of Duty have held onto a sizable - if shrinking - slice of physical sales. A further drop in boxed numbers this year was somewhat inevitable, though a 30 percent fall is something of a jump.

PayDay 3's matchmaking issues have been fixed, developer Starbreeze has announced. 
</p><p>
In a new release, the developer stated scheduled maintenance had successfully addressed the server issues that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-players-endure-second-consecutive-day-of-server-issues-preventing-them-from-playing">plagued Payday 3's launch</a> and prevented players from actually being able to play the game. Starbreeze said matchmaking is now "stable" and has "good performance". 
</p><p>
In addition, the developer has said it will now "intensify" Payday 3's commercial activities, having put these on pause as it tried to sort out those matchmaking issues. This will include an update, due early this month, that will see "200+" quality of life improvements added across platforms.

## The Wings Of Sycamore captures the adventurous spirit of early aviation

Flight can be fascinating stuff in video games. Some games get bogged down in complicated simulation mechanics, others opt for aerial combat, while many limit your time in the air to quick transport. These are all valid uses of flight, yet there's something wonderfully adventurous about simply exploring virtual worlds from the skies, and perhaps mixing in some challenges to keep life interesting. Pilotwings 64 was my earliest experience of flight before I  jumped towards Ultrawings in more recent years. Looking at The Wings of Sycamore, I believe it holds similar potential.

Shown at the <a href="https://www.wasdlive.com/">WASD event</a> this September, the game's booth had old-school aeronautical styling that quickly caught my eye. Featuring an anthropomorphic cast in a Victoriana inspired world, The Wings of Sycamore immedi
