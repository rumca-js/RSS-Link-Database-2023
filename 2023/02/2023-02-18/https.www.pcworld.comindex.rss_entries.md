<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to pick up a new PC mouse for your home office setup, you should consider getting one specifically designed for gaming. They&rsquo;re responsive, customizable, and come in all different shapes and sizes. Plus, there are tons of wired and wireless options out there. You don&rsquo;t even have to be a gamer to use one. If you&rsquo;re not totally convinced, don&rsquo;t worry, I aim to persuade. Read on to learn several compelling reasons why a gaming mouse is good for anyone.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>To see more options, check out our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/452384/best-gaming-mice.html">best PC gaming mice</a>.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 id="sensitivity">Sensitivity</h2>



<p>Gaming mice feature a higher DPI (dots per inch) than traditional mice, which directly impacts sensitivity and responsiveness. DPI is a good indication of how fast your mouse will move across the screen. The higher the number, the faster it will travel. For gaming mice, DPI can be anywhere from 400 to 26,000 DPI. That&rsquo;s a massive range, I know. Typically, the higher number is important to those who play faster-paced games, in which every second matters. That said, for general use, you don&rsquo;t need a super-high DPI.</p>



<p>Luckily, most gaming mice have a physical button that allows you to change the DPI on the fly. If you pick up a mouse with no DPI button, then you can easily change it in your computer settings. For everyday tasks, the most comfortable range is 800 to 1,200. Anything faster than that and the mouse will quickly get away from you. </p>



<h2 id="ergonomics">Ergonomics</h2>



<p>Gaming mice are designed to be used for long periods of time, so personal comfort is a major factor. They offer a natural grip and a naturally comfortable place to rest your thumb. This helps alleviate any strain on the hand or wrist. They&rsquo;re also designed for different grip styles like palm, claw, and fingertip. Traditional mice, on the other hand, tend to be flat and not raised or sloped. They lack the support needed to keep your hand in a natural position. </p>

<h2 id="extra-buttons-and-macro-abilities">Extra buttons and macro abilities</h2>



<p>Gaming mice allow you to bind the physical buttons to software, in-game commands, and so on. The idea is to easily access time-saving shortcuts. The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VNPB6Q1&amp;xcust=2-1-1513804-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">SteelSeries Aerox 9</a>, for example, has up to 18 programmable buttons. However, if you&rsquo;re using a gaming mouse for work or everyday tasks, that many buttons may be overkill. That said, you can still program these buttons to help maximize your workflow and save you time. You can set them up to copy and paste information, close and open browser tabs, and so on. Traditional mice don&rsquo;t have all these extra buttons, which means you&rsquo;ll spend more time clicking around.</p>



<h2 id="rgb-lighting">RGB lighting</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1480558/why-do-gamers-like-rgb-lights.html">RGB lighting</a> is just plain fun. However, it has no effect on the functionality of the mouse. It&rsquo;s just there to set the mood. If you&rsquo;re looking to add a little flair to your home setup, RGB lighting is the way to go. Personally, I use the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08176SM7C&amp;xcust=2-1-1513804-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">SteelSeries Rival 3</a> gaming mouse and I love looking at the flow of rainbow lights. It&rsquo;s super mesmerizing and relaxing. If you find RBG lighting too distracting, you can always switch it off. </p>

<p>Plugable&rsquo;s USB-C Dual 4K HDMI and DisplayPort Display Horizontal Docking Station with 100W Charging (or the UD-6950PDH for short) falls into the category of a USB-C docking station, a DisplayLink dock that can be used with either a Thunderbolt or generic USB-C port. It&rsquo;s a superb value, with a wide range of features for a reasonable price that&rsquo;s in line with most budget Thunderbolt docks.</p>



<p>Plugable&rsquo;s UD-6950PDH doesn&rsquo;t allow the bandwidth for the latest HDMI or DisplayPort interfaces. But the dock preserves what we like about Plugable&rsquo;s docks: two pairs of optional DisplayPort and HDMI connections to choose from, as well as 100W of charging power to your laptop. One omission, however, is a dedicated charging port for powering a smartphone, or any USB-C port at all.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: To learn about competing products, what to look for in a Thunderbolt or DisplayLink dock, and get buying recommendations, see our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc.html">best Thunderbolt docks</a>.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>A DisplayLink USB-C docking station uses data compression to push data across the USB-C interface, approximating the experience of a much more expensive Thunderbolt dock. As such, it&rsquo;s not plug-and-play, but requires a software driver that can be easily downloaded from Plugable, after which your computer will need to be restarted. The driver isn&rsquo;t specific to Plugable, so it will work with other USB-C docks, too.</p>



<p>You probably won&rsquo;t need to explore many more options. The DisplayLink docks we&rsquo;ve tested generally provide solid connections for office work, though the massive amounts of data PC gaming requires can impact the dock&rsquo;s performance. Specifically, the UD-6950PDH includes two groups of a DisplayPort 1.2 and an HDMI 1.4 port, one group per display. Plugable also includes five 5Gbps USB-A ports (three on the front, two on the back) and both a microSD (supporting up to MicroSDXC) and an SD slot (supporting up to SDXC, RSMMC, or MMCPlus). There&rsquo;s gigabit ethernet, a mic and a headphone jack, as well as a small blue LED power indicator.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Plugable&rsquo;s UD-6950PDH is an appealing alternative to a Thunderbolt dock for older hardware and offers great value.</p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Plugable UD-6950PDH back" class="wp-image-1512889" height="652" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Plugable-UD-6950PDH-back.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The rear of the Plugable UD-6950PDH USB-C 4K docking station.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>Note that Plugable doesn&rsquo;t specify a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402876/how-to-buy-the-best-sd-card.html">speed rating for the SD cards</a>, possibly because the transfer speed between your PC will be affected by how much data is being transferred over the 5Gbps, 3-foot USB-C cable at any one time. However, using AJA System Test&rsquo;s storage benchmark on an SDXC UHS-II VP90 card, we found that the performance on the card mounted inside the dock (259MB/s read, 240MB/s write) was comparable or slightly better than inserting the card into a dedicated slot on our laptop.</p>



<h2 id="a-dearth-of-power">A dearth of power</h2>



<p>The problem here is the external power that the Plugable UD-6950PDH provides&mdash;or rather, doesn&rsquo;t provide&mdash;to individual devices. The dock powered connected USB mice, keyboards, USB keys, and a pair of 4K displays absolutely acceptably for day-to-day office work, but Windows refused to recognize a 10Gbps USB 3.2 external SSD when connected to Plugable&rsquo;s dock because it didn&rsquo;t supply enough power. It worked just fine when powered by its own, dedicated laptop port, however. Given what we saw in SD transfer rates, we conclude that you&rsquo;ll be best served transferring <em>and</em> editing photos and video directly on the SD card, or transferring them first to your PC&rsquo;s SSD or hard drive for editing. </p>



<p>Put another way, the USB-A ports supply just 2.5W, fine for powering some peripherals and some basic (not fast-) charging of smartphones, but that&rsquo;s all.</p>



<p>You may also see some reduced frame rates in games, as the dock struggles to push enough data across the bus. (Plugable doesn&rsquo;t recommend this dock for gaming, either.) Plugable also notes that the HDMI 1.4 interface should only be capable of powering a 4K30 display, but ours reported a 60Hz connection.</p>



<p>In our video tests, though, the UD-6950PDH dock performed well. We stream a 4K60 YouTube video and check to see if it drops frames while playing back. The dock didn&rsquo;t, either by itself or when pushing a gigabyte of data across the bus. The same held true for playing the video over Wi-Fi or the dock&rsquo;s ethernet. (Technically, it dropped 52 frames out of 10,000 over Wi-Fi, which we consider acceptable, and didn&rsquo;t produce any noticeable video stuttering.) Netflix played without issue.</p>



<p>The $199 (MSRP) price tag, though, makes this Plugable dock especially appealing. Many USB-C docking stations that use DisplayLink have been priced in the range of Thunderbolt docks, and the UD-6950PDH fits within the niche we&rsquo;d expect it to be: about the price of a budget Thunderbolt dock.</p>



<p>The bottom line: if you&rsquo;re buying Plugable&rsquo;s USB-C Dual 4K HDMI and DisplayPort Display Horizontal Docking Station with 100W Charging (UD-6950PDH) for office use, we think you&rsquo;ll be pleased. Just don&rsquo;t forget your smartphone charger.</p>
