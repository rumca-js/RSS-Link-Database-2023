Drug use, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chicago-homeless-encampment" target="_blank">homelessness</a>, the entire city of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/san-francisco-police-36-hours" target="_blank">San Francisco</a>. And the fact that our President can barely string two words together, of course. But recently, a highly concerning sign is emerging: the decline of our children. </p><p>Lately, horrific stories of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/school-bus-florida" target="_blank">bullying</a> have shed light on what's really going on inside our nation's public schools. One instance was so bad, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/adriana-kuch-school-superintendent-blames" target="_blank">the young girl committed suicide</a>, and the school somehow still refused to take responsibility. Our children are forgetting how to act as humans, perhaps because their parents forgot first. </p><p>A fresh example of this comes from a <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/chik-fil-a-meltdown" target="_blank">Chick-fil-a</a> in Pennsylvania. This Chick-fil-a had to ban adolescents under the age of 16 without a parent or guardian because they were behaving so poorly. If you know anything about Chick-fil-a, you know that their employees are some of the kindest people around. It's a bit like being inside Santa's toy shop, except instead of toys, it's chicken. So these kids must've been <em>really</em> misbehaving to piss off the equivalent of Santa's elves. </p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet">
<div style="margin: 1em 0;">\u201cYour know a culture is in serious decline when a local Chick-Fil-A has to beg parents to require their children to act in a way that is compatible with the basic decency required in a functioning society. \n\nThis reads like a homily on the fall of Western civilization.\u201d</div> — Megan Brock (@Megan Brock)
        <a href="https://twitter.com/MegEBrock/status/1628503028356481026">1677100352</a>
</blockquote>

<p>In a Facebook post, the Chick-fil-a detailed the unacceptable behaviors of these rowdy adolescents:</p><p> <em>"They are loud, and their conversation often contains a lot of explicit language [...] Food and trash are often thrown around and left on the tables, chairs, and on the floor. Tables and restrooms are vandalized. Decorations are stolen [...] Employees are laughed at, made fun of, and treated rudely." </em></p><p>The post went on to explain that the Chick-fil-a is not blaming the parents, they just can't permit kids to "test boundaries" in their restaurant. Not having any kids myself, I don't want to be too quick to blame parents. However, I can't see who else is at fault here. Parents are undeniably responsible for teaching their children to behave and treat people respectfully. The parents of some of these troublemakers might be doing that, but they clearly aren't attentive enough to their children's, ahem, "extracurricular" activities. </p><p>Overall, it's a sad day when Chick-fil-a has to ban anyone from their holy chicken. On the bright side, the comments on the Facebook post were overwhelmingly positive and supportive of the restaurant's decision. So maybe this isn't the fall of Western civilization. Yet. </p>

MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell lied to Vice President Kamala Harris when she said Ron DeSantis wanted to prevent Florida school children from learning about slavery. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/andrea-mitchell-kamala-harris-desantis" target="_blank">Team DeSantis called her out</a>. Mitchell was forced to clarify she was "imprecise" and followed up with more lies.  <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/andrea-mitchell-apologizes-team-desantis" target="_blank">Team DeSantis shut that down too</a>.</p><p>Now it was Ron's turn. Three words: "basically media lies."</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">DeSantis addresses liberal media misinfo on FL removing explicit books: “They are doing that to try to create a narrative...because they know there is enough people in corporate media who will just take that, and run with that…if it is explicit and <a href="https://t.co/Y4yQpBSjrB">pic.twitter.com/Y4yQpBSjrB</a>… <a href="https://t.co/smnI0CAcqA">https://t.co/smnI0CAcqA</a><br />— Mary Margaret Olohan (@MaryMargOlohan) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaryMargOlohan/status/1628783879271088128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>"They are lying to you. They are doing that to try to create a narrative, they’re not doing that because Florida has a law. They’re doing it because they know there is enough people in corporate media who will just take that, and run with that."</blockquote><p>This part is my favorite:</p><blockquote>We've got all these examples cataloged of, basically, media lies to try and do the hoax.</blockquote><p>Guess what, MSNBC?</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>No one in Florida needs to remove biographies of Hank Aaron and Roberto Clemente from the shelves. There aren't empty bookshelves in Florida school libraries. What happens is that people who hate DeSantis make dishonest TikToks. Then people working at MSNBC and CNN who hate all conservatives parrot it because they saw something on the internet. When the slightest bit of journalism would show that it was all bullsh*t.</p><p>The media is our enemy. DeSantis knows this and makes the case in a way the even apolitical people pick up on.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">This was a very effective response. I don’t know if corporate media will actually cover it, but regardless of whether you like <a href="https://twitter.com/RonDeSantisFL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RonDeSantisFL</a> or not, he is an effective communicator. <a href="https://t.co/F9F9xlndwd">https://t.co/F9F9xlndwd</a><br />— Darvio Morrow (@DTheKingpin) <a href="https://twitter.com/DTheKingpin/status/1628863247003549697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>What I want to see now is Team DeSantis' "catalog." Expose the journalismers one by one. </p><p><p>

## WATCH: 'The View' Does Insane Mental Gymnastics, Blames Donald Trump and Ohio Voters For Train Derailment

<p>Joy Behar kicked off the discussion by shaming the residents of East Palestine for voting for Donald Trump.

Donald Trump, who reduces all safety. He did, in those days.”  </em>This was such a bad take, even the audience audibly groaned.

<p>So I guess we can add train derailments to the growing list of evils Trump is somehow responsible for. It is truly remarkable that, even though he's no longer President, he's so deeply embedded into these people's brains. They just can't stop talking about him. It's like a mind virus. A very orange, snarky mind virus. </p><p>They're also probably a little desperate to find a boogeyman to distract from <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/east-palestine-mayor-biden" target="_blank">Biden's surprise visit to Ukraine</a> amidst the disaster, and FEMA denying emergency assistance to East Palestine. As a rule of thumb, it's typically better for a President to be <em>in</em> the country during a time of crisis, and not overseas, pledging billions of taxpayers' dollars to foreign countries. Biden Admin, take notes. </p>

## OpEd: Biden’s Ukraine Commitment is Self-Sabotage, And China is Loving it

<img src="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=33081855&amp;width=1245&amp;height=700&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0" /><br /><br /><p>
	On Monday, President Biden made an unexpected appearance in Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to reiterate Washington’s sustained commitment to Ukraine in its war with Russia.
</p><p>
	Besides the terrible optics of <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/east-palestine-mayor-biden-ukraine" target="_blank">Biden dedicating time and resources to visiting a foreign country</a> while he has <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trump-east-palestine-visit" target="_blank">yet to set foot anywhere near East Palestine, Ohio</a>, important geopolitical considerations were also at play.
</p><p>
	Speaking to a room of reporters, with Zelenskyy standing by his side, Biden repeated a dictate that he has made countless times since Russia invaded nearly one year ago; that the United States will stand with Ukraine for “as long as it takes.”
</p><p>
	However, per usual, Biden failed to give a detailed account of what exactly that means, and what an acceptable endgame might look like. Does “as long as it takes” mean until Ukraine recaptures all its original territory in a total defeat of Russian forces? Does it mean until the Putin regime is overthrown, and a puppet government is installed in Moscow? Who knows? Certainly not policy makers in DC.
</p><p>
	While the timetable of “as long as it takes’” is a mystery to us all, if the previous year is any indicator the substance of the commitment is easier to speculate. It likely means a perpetual signing of blank checks to Ukrainian leadership with little to no oversight over how the money is being used.
</p><p>
	Since the beginning of the war, Congress has dedicated $113.1 billion in aid packages to Ukraine, including $67.1 billion for defense and $46 billion in non-defense related materials. But once the money is appropriated, there is little oversight into where exactly it ends up.
</p><p>
	According to the <a href="https://www.dodig.mil/Portals/48/FY2023_JSOP_UKRAINE_RESPONSE.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Joint Strategic Oversight Plan for Ukraine Response report</a> released in January, "State is overseeing unprecedented levels of security assistance in Ukraine, presenting significant risk of misuse and diversion given the volume and speed of assistance and the wartime operating environment."
</p><p>
	Perhaps more concerning than the raw dollar figure the US has committed to Ukraine is the actual ammunition and weaponry. Aside from Washington’s latest high profile commitment to Kyiv, in which it has promised to send <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/01/25/germany-leopard-tanks-abrams-ukraine/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">31 M1 Abrams tanks</a>, it has already supplied Ukraine with massive amounts of hard materials. According to a <a href="https://www.state.gov/u-s-security-cooperation-with-ukraine/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fact sheet</a> published by the State Department on February 3<sup>rd</sup>, this includes:
</p><ul>
<li>Over 1,600 Stinger missiles</li>
<li>Over 8,500 Javelin missiles</li>
<li>Over 54,000 other anti-armor systems and munitions</li>
<li>100,000,000 rounds of small arms ammunition</li>
<li>Hundreds of thousands of rounds of various other artillery</li>
</ul><p>
	While supplying weapons to the Ukrainian people in their fight against a revisionist power is admirable on its face, and certainly makes sense emotionally, it’s not our elected leaders’ job to make foreign policy decisions based on emotion. Instead, they should employ a more realist decision making process. By examining support of Ukraine through this lens it would be readily apparent that a carte blanche support of Kyiv’s war effort does not come without very real tradeoffs.
</p><p>
	By definition, the more weapons we provide to Ukraine, the fewer we have the potential to utilize in other more important theaters, namely the Asia-Pacific.
</p><p>
	While leadership in Washington has rightfully acknowledged that China is our greatest strategic rival, and the defense of Taiwan is crucial to American interests, policy makers continue to send gobs of money and weapons to Ukraine ignoring the negative consequences this may incur should the US find itself in open conflict with China.
</p><p>
	Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) acutely outlined this dilemma in a <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-delivers-national-security-speech-china-and-ukraine-time-truth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">speech</a> at the Heritage Foundation last week. “For starters, the more U.S. resources we devote to Europe, the fewer we have available to strengthen deterrence in the Pacific,” Hawley said. “For some things, like heavy armor units, that may not matter much. But it matters a lot for the capabilities we need to deter China from invading Taiwan.”
</p><p>
	He continued, “Both Ukraine and Taiwan require many of the same weapons, including things like Javelin and Stinger missiles. And our industrial base is strapped for capacity. That’s because we need to draw on many of the same suppliers for the defense of both Ukraine and Taiwan.”
</p><p>
	As Hawley notes, our industrial base <em>is</em> strapped, but this language is really not strong enough. Thanks to a lack of urgency from the Pentagon and massive consolidation efforts by defense contractors, the US defense industry is drastically unprepared for a conflict with China.
</p><p>
	According to a Center for Strategic International Studies (CSIS) <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/empty-bins-wartime-environment-challenge-us-defense-industrial-base" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>, the US would run out of key long-range, precision-guided munitions in less than one week if a battle over Taiwan were to break out. The CSIS study also notes that shipments of Javelin and Stinger missiles and counter-artillery radars and 155mm artillery shells to Ukraine have depleted US stockpiles.
</p><p>
	“The United States has been slow to replenish its arsenal, and the DoD has only placed a contract on a fraction of the weapons it sent to Ukraine,” the report states.
</p><p>
	All these weapons systems would be crucial for a defense of Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.
</p><p>
	Underscoring China’s keen interest in the Russia-Ukraine war, the day after Biden paraded through the streets of Kyiv, China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, landed in Moscow where he participated in talks with President Vladimir Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
</p><p>
	Wang, addressing the two countries’ special relationship vowed to work with Russia to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/chinas-top-diplomat-vows-to-firmly-defend-national-territories-with-russia/DF7E47D7-6DCE-432C-B094-E27A16A5A32F.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“firmly defend respective national territories and national pride.”</a>
</p><p>
	Lavrov echoed the sentiment adding, “Our ties have continued to develop dynamically and despite high turbulence in the global arena, we have shown the readiness to speak in defense of each other’s interests.”
</p><p>
	These warm diplomatic sentiments between China and Russia were exchanged just days after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned the US possessed intelligence that China may be considering supplying lethal arms to Russia. Blinken added on Wednesday that the Biden administration was considering declassifying this intelligence, though no final decision had been made. 
</p><p>
	Considering the prospect of increased Chinese cooperation with Russia, President Zelenskyy declared, “if China allies itself with Russia, there will be a world war.”</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">It is the US, not China, that has been pouring weapons into the battlefield in Ukraine. The US is in no position to tell China what to do. China will never accept US finger-pointing or coercion on China-Russia relations. <a href="https://t.co/H6krhOqYtc">pic.twitter.com/H6krhOqYtc</a><br />— Spokesperson发言人办公室 (@MFA_China) <a href="https://twitter.com/MFA_China/status/1627629464556539904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>Although China has denied claims it plans to arm Russia, and has criticized the US for trying to coerce Sino-Russia relations, the truth is China has been tacitly supporting Russia for the entirety of its war by propping up its economy via massive procurements of LNG, oil, and coal. More directly, China has supplied the Russian military with commercial drones manufactured by DJI. These drones are then outfitted in Russia for military use.<br /></p><p>
	Whether China plans to increase involvement by supplying more lethal aid remains to be seen, but Beijing’s motivation for doing so would be two-fold. It would help ensure that Russia, China’s only major power ally, is not defeated. And given US policy towards Ukraine so far, by helping to extend the conflict China would also be able to bleed the US of critical strategic weapons and political capital. The longer the US is involved with Ukraine, the less resolve the American public will likely have when it comes time to sacrifice for Taiwan.
</p><p>
	Biden loves to frame the Russia-Ukraine war as a battle of democracy vs autocracy. While it may be to an extent, deciding US foreign policy on those grounds is foolish. A hardheaded realism that understands the tradeoffs arming and supporting Ukraine requires is desperately needed.
</p><p>
	To speak in terms Biden’s liberal sensibilities might resonate with, by blindly continuing carte blanche support of Ukraine, the US is forfeiting its future ability to defend another even more liberal and more democratic ally. However, in the case of Taiwan, unlike Ukraine, the US would not only be defending a liberal democracy, but one that is vital to American interests.

## Watch: Mark Wahlberg knows believing in Jesus isn't popular in Hollywood, but refuses to deny his faith

We grew up with Marky Mark, what's-his-face from New Kids on the Block's kid brother. He's become an incredible actor, whether he is getting high with a talking bear or playing heavy, dramatic roles. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mark-wahlberg-celebrities-politics" target="_self">He doesn't play the usual douchey-liberal Hollywood games</a>. And he's also not afraid to talk about his faith. It's a major no-no in Hollywood when it's one of the faiths centered around Jesus.</p><p>Wahlberg was on the <em>Today Show</em> for Ash Wednesday where he admits having faith and even discussing religion is frowned upon in his line of work. But denying it is an even bigger sin.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">On NBC, Mark Wahlberg on using his platform for sharing faith: "I don't wanna jam it down anybody's throat. But I do not deny my faith, that's an even bigger sin." He reminds us "God didn't come to save the saints, he came to save the sinners." Humility is key during Lent. 2/2 <a href="https://t.co/tUkAEku1Jb">pic.twitter.com/tUkAEku1Jb</a><br />— Tim Graham (@TimJGraham) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimJGraham/status/1628424604443082752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><p>It's pathetic that such uncontroversial comments stand out as notable when repeated on television. Especially on NBC News, which <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/andrea-mitchell-apologizes-team-desantis" target="_blank">has been su-doddly-ucking harder than usual lately</a>. But that's where we are. It's rare for an A-list actor not named Chris Pratt to speak openly about prayer and faith. "Openly" is the keyword. </p><p>On an episode of the Joe Rogan podcast, <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/matthew-mcconaughey-hollywood-christian" target="_self">Matthew McConaughey spoke to the fear and hypocrisy in Hollywood</a>: "I have had moments where I was on stage receiving an award in front of my peers in Hollywood, and there were people in the crowd that I have prayed with before dinners many times, and when I thanked God, I saw some of those people go to clap, but then notice that, 'bad thing on my resume' and then sit back on their hands."</p><p>Talking about how important faith is and acknowledging any of the Jesus bassed religions is frowned upon in Hollywood and rare to see coming through our television. That's why it's important for him to keep doing so.</p><p>Also, I know Wahlberg would prefer we forget it exists, but "Good Vibrations" still slaps. Don't act like you don't feel it feel it.</p><p><p>
