In Jedi: Survivor, the Crossguard lightsaber stance is the equivalent to wielding a massive two-handed sword - and it makes sense that a giant chunk of metal would be heavier, but why would a lightsaber be harder to wield because of it’s blade configuration? Well, short answer, because it’s not real, duh, but we still asked game director Stig Asmussen to explain the logic for Cal’s changed movement while using this stance in combat.
