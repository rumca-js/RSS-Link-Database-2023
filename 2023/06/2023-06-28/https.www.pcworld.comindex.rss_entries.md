<p>The US military has organized the Hack-A-Sat 4 competition to take place during the annual Defcon hacker convention in August. The goal of the contestants is to take over a satellite in orbit around the Earth. </p>



<p>Eight hacker teams from the US, Australia, Italy, Poland and Germany emerged from the April qualifiers, where more than 380 teams registered. If all goes according to plan, the hackers will compete in Las Vegas during Defcon, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newsweek.com/eight-teams-hackers-will-compete-breach-us-satellite-space-1808270&amp;xcust=2-2-1972586-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">reports Newsweek</a>. The participants are so-called &ldquo;white-hat&rdquo; hackers who engage in ethical hacking, attacking systems on behalf of their owners to identify various security flaws.</p>



<p>The competition is organized by the US Air Force Research Laboratory. On previous occasions, the target has been a satellite that has remained down here on Earth, but this year the contestants will target an orbiting satellite.</p>



<p>The satellite that the hackers are targeting is called Moonlighter, and is designed to be vulnerable to hacker attacks. The satellite is about the size of a toaster and has several security features. For example, it is not equipped with its own engines. Controllers will also be able to reboot the satellite&rsquo;s system and kick out any intruders if necessary.</p>

## Clippy is back in a new, unauthorized Windows AI app

<p>When Microsoft debuted its AI-powered Bing Chat, the obvious point of comparison was Clippy, the virtual assistant users loved and/or loathed in Microsoft Office 97. Now Clippy is back, in a new, unauthorized app that somehow has made it onto the Microsoft Store.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/clippy-by-firecube/9NWK37S35V5T&amp;xcust=2-1-1972377-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Clippy by Firecube</a> uses Microsoft&rsquo;s animated paper clip, Clippy (known as Clippit to purists), as a front end for ChatGPT 3.5, the AI chatbot developed by OpenAI. Although the app refers to Clippy by name, the full text description of the app immediately identifies it as &ldquo;Not by Microsoft&rdquo; to presumably fend off any lawyers that might be sniffing about the app. Firecube has a good reputation as a developer who looks deeply into new Windows code for unpublicized features. </p>



<p>Basically, Clippy by Firecube looks like a front end for ChatGPT. So why use it? Nostalgia. </p>



<p>Clippy/Clippit, otherwise known as the Microsoft Paperclip, persisted in Office for Windows 97 until 2003, according to Wikipedia. As many may remember, Clippy was just one of various incarnations of the Office Assistant, which could appear as The Genius, Power Pup the dog, Scribble the cat, and more. It was eventually killed off by default in Office XP. Later, Clippy landed in the &ldquo;it&rsquo;s so bad it&rsquo;s good&rdquo; category of pop culture, and today the paperclip emoji within Windows (type the Windows key, then a semicolon) is Clippy by default.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that Clippy by Firecube probably won&rsquo;t have a long shelf life. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1924008/windows-copilot-will-bring-ai-into-windows-11.html">Microsoft is expected to debut Windows Copilot</a> sometime this summer. (Officially, the feature is scheduled to debut before the end of June, which ends shortly.) The difference between Windows Copilot and Clippy by Firecube goes beyond the name. While Clippy by Firecube is essentially a ChatGPT interface, Windows Copilot should have deep hooks into the Windows operating system. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="Clippy by Firecube " class="wp-image-1972435" height="915" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Clippy-by-Firecube.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><a class="imageCredit" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/clippy-by-firecube/9NWK37S35V5T&amp;xcust=2-1-1972377-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Firecube</a></div>



<p>The difference between the two AI bots is further explained by the screenshot Firecube published. In it, Clippy&rsquo;s ChatGPT interface can tell you how you how to change the Windows background, but that&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s likely that Windows Copilot will actually perform that task for you, if you ask. Otherwise, both Windows Copilot and Clippy by Firecube both run on top of ChatGPT, so other answers should be similar.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s also another small, but key difference: personality. Microsoft has a had a love/hate relationship with injecting personality into its chatbots, from Tay to its recent misadventures with Bing Chat&rsquo;s AI personality. Windows Copilot will most likely be a no-nonsense chatbot. Clippy, however, was deliberately, er, helpful, and will probably remain so. </p>



<p>Clippy by Firecube, though a free app, does require an API key, a token that identifies you and links to your account. You can sign up for one at OpenAI&rsquo;s site <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://Hello%20there!%20To%20use%20this%20app%20you%20need%20a%20valid%20OpenAI%20API%20key.%20You%20can%20obtain%20one%20by%20visiting%20https://beta.openai.com/signup/&amp;xcust=2-1-1972377-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">here</a>. While the signup is free (and so is a trial) the OpenAI API assigns your account free credits that are used up as you use the Clippy by Firecube app. You&rsquo;ll also need to trust the app itself, as you&rsquo;ll be supplying a paid token to the publisher. Windows Copilot, however, will likely be entirely free, as is Bing Chat.  </p>



<p>Still, if you&rsquo;re looking for a blast from the past and don&rsquo;t mind a quick setup process, Clippy by Firecube may be for you.</p>

## This absurd password game is wonderfully unhinged
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1972433/this-password-game-makes-choosing-a-strong-one-absurdly-fun.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1972433/this-password-game-makes-choosing-a-strong-one-absurdly-fun.html)

<p>Ah, password requirements. They&rsquo;re necessary&mdash;left to our own devices, many of us would simply choose &ldquo;<em>password.</em>&rdquo; They&rsquo;re also sometimes frustrating, since every website puts its own spin on it. (Looking at you, financial websites that only allow 12 letters or numbers and no special characters.) But few get as amusingly goofy as <em>The Password Game</em>, which challenges you to fulfill increasingly absurd requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Released on Tuesday by Neal Agarwal, this <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://neal.fun/password-game/&amp;xcust=2-2-1972433-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">browser-based game</a> starts off innocuously enough: Pick a password. Then make it at least five characters long. Then include a number. An uppercase letter. A special character. That&rsquo;s all standard, and we&rsquo;ve all seen plenty of that in the real world.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="The Password Game rules 10 and 11" class="wp-image-1972439" height="434" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/thepasswordgame1.png?w=1200" width="815" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>This is going to take me awhile.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>But after that, things begin getting wild. You have to mention a sponsor in your password, for starters. And math rears its ugly head, reminding us (me) how rusty we&rsquo;ve become at it. Not saying this will happen to you, but I&rsquo;ve discovered I can&rsquo;t quickly solve numeral requirements and may be going slightly insane.</p>



<p>The fun part about this puzzle game (and I do find it fun) is how it highlights the usefulness of a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">good password manager</a>. Sure, as you progress in the game, you actually end up with a decent password. But remembering it on your own? Good luck. Far easier to leave that work to software or a service of your choosing, and let it generate <em>and</em> store the passwords for you.</p>



<p>As you play the game yourself, just be aware: Its creator knows what chaos it wreaks. As spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcgamer.com/this-unhinged-browser-game-about-passwords-is-the-most-messed-up-thing-ive-ever-played/&amp;xcust=2-2-1972433-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, a tweet went up yesterday that openly admits the &ldquo;rules in this game [&hellip;] ensure I will never see the pearly gates.&rdquo;</p>

## AI is filling up the internet with garbage spam sites

<p>A new wave of artificial intelligence tools like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424575/chatgpt-is-the-future-of-ai-chatbots.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1666669/google-bards-ai-search-launch-was-well-boring.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Google Bard</a> may or may not change the way humans interact with technology forever. But before it does that, it&rsquo;s going to make the internet even more annoying. According to a new report, AI is being used to generate a huge amount of websites filled with random, garbage strings of text targeted at search engines, then plastered with advertising to generate revenue. </p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newsguardtech.com/misinformation-monitor/june-2023/&amp;xcust=2-1-1971683-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">NewsGuard reports</a> that AI text generation tools are being combined with software that auto-generates new sites, creating masses of domains filled with a huge amount of text. The sites are then filled with <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising#Advertising_sales_and_delivery_models&amp;xcust=2-1-1971683-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">programmatic advertising slots</a>, which serve up real ads over the fake content. It could be argued that the process is fraud, since advertisers are paying for ads in good faith that&rsquo;s presumably written by humans. The combination of largely automatic advertising systems and websites that can be generated by the dozen with few clicks is creating a feedback loop, where AI-generated content with practically zero human input is being financed by advertising algorithms so vast and complex that barely any humans understand them. </p>



<p>AI-generated text can be difficult to distinguish from merely generic or bad writing &mdash; after all, filling up sites with low-quality content and selling advertising on top of it is hardly a new practice. To solve this problem, NewsGuard searched for telltale phrases that AI systems sometime return for queries, such as &ldquo;Sorry, as an AI language model, I am not able to access external links or websites on my own.&rdquo; That phrase was spotted in a headline for a jobs site&hellip;that was supposed to be Brazilian in origin. All in all, the investigation found over 200 &ldquo;news&rdquo; sites generated with AI text, one of which was publishing more than 1,200 new articles every day. And these were just the ones that were easily spotted with error messages. </p>



<p>Not every single one of these sites was serving advertisements, but over a quarter were, with 141 major brands paying for ads over garbage content. Major banks, sports clothing vendors, broadband providers, and streaming services are serving up ads aimed at web users in the US, Germany, France, and Italy, four of the most lucrative markets for web advertising. That likely means that the creators are getting enough revenue to justify their efforts, even if the majority of the sites and content generated are duds. </p>



<p>With AI being used to create everything from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-launches-boom-ai-written-e-books-amazon-2023-02-21/&amp;xcust=2-1-1971683-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">novels sold on Amazon</a>, to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2023/06/08/desantis-ad-showing-fake-ai-images-of-trump-hugging-fauci-enrages-maga-supporters/?sh=56efbfc046ca&amp;xcust=2-1-1971683-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fake political ads</a>, to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chatgpt-judge-fines-lawyers-who-used-ai/&amp;xcust=2-1-1971683-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">bogus legal citations</a> used in a very real courtroom, it&rsquo;s clear that easy access to massive amounts of auto-generated text and images is a growing problem. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="laptops">Laptops</h2>



<p>The Dell Inspiron 14 2-in-1 laptop, which we&rsquo;ve highlighted below, deserves its own call-out because it&rsquo;s so versatile. You can swing the screen around 360 degrees and use it like a tablet or prop it up like a camper&rsquo;s tent for movie watching. It also weighs just 3.61 pounds, which is pretty lightweight.</p>

## PC bottlenecks explained: How to know if your CPU or GPU is limiting games

<p>If your PC doesn&rsquo;t deliver the desired performance in a particular game, it&rsquo;s usually&mdash;but not always&mdash;due to two limiting factors. Either your processor (CPU) or your graphics card (GPU) is bottlenecking performance.</p>



<p>How can you find out which of these two essential hardware components is slowing down your gaming performance? This guide will explain everything you need to know. But first, you need to understand what a CPU bottleneck or GPU bottleneck actually is, and what it means for your system.</p>

<p>A CPU bottleneck occurs when your graphics card works faster than the CPU. You can tell you&rsquo;re encountering a CPU bottleneck when your GPU isn&rsquo;t fully utilized. (The utilization of the CPU is irrelevant.)</p>



<p>If your processor&rsquo;s performance isn&rsquo;t sufficient to keep pace with your game, this can lead to a slowdown because the graphics card can&rsquo;t be fully unleashed. That&rsquo;s a CPU bottleneck.</p>

<p>Conversely, a GPU bottleneck occurs when your graphics card cannot keep up with CPU&rsquo;s output.</p>



<p>When your GPU is bottlenecked, the graphics card can calculate fewer images per second than the CPU was able to prepare beforehand. The system is therefore unable to realize its full gaming potential. In these cases, you&rsquo;ll probably need to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">upgrade to a new graphics card</a> to eke out more performance.</p>



<h2 class="toc wp-block-heading" id="how-do-know-if-your-games-are-cpu-or-gpu-bottlenecked">How do know if your games are CPU or GPU bottlenecked?</h2>



<p>A CPU bottleneck happens when the graphics card does its work in such a short time that it has to wait for the processor to provide the appropriate data for the next image to be rendered. In those cases, the graphics card, no matter how fast it is, cannot be utilized to its full capacity. </p>



<p>But how exactly can you find out if there is a CPU bottleneck? Proceed as follows:</p>



<ol><li>Download and install <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.pcwelt.de/article/1135318/msi-afterburner.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1955495-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">MSI Afterburner</a>.</li><li>In Afterburners settings options, activate the GPU load option for the overlay.</li><li>Start the game you want to play.</li><li>Pay attention to the GPU utilization rate on Afterburner&rsquo;s overlay while you play. It&rsquo;s important that you read the GPU load during a typical game scene. The values in the menu or when paused aren&rsquo;t meaningful.</li></ol>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="MSI Afterburner" class="wp-image-1946112" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MSI-Afterburner.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The free MSI Afterburner helps to identify CPU and GPU limits</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">MSI</p></div>



<p>You can use the GPU load information to determine whether there&rsquo;s a CPU or GPU bottleneck in the game you&rsquo;re testing:</p>



<p><strong>&ge; 95 percent:</strong> GPU limit = The graphics card limits the performance<br /><strong>&lt; 95 percent:</strong> CPU limit = The processor limits the performance</p>



<p>If your graphics card is utilized between 95 and 100 percent, the processor is strong enough and supplies the GPU sufficiently. If the GPU is used 80 percent or less, that means you&rsquo;re hitting a strong CPU bottleneck. </p>



<h2 class="toc wp-block-heading" id="your-gaming-pc-has-a-bottleneck-what-should-you-do">Your gaming PC has a bottleneck. What should you do? </h2>



<p>If you find that your processor is bottlenecking your gaming performance, you should choose a higher resolution if possible. Shifting to a higher resolution (like 1440p or 4K) puts more focus on the GPU, if your graphics card and monitor are up to the task. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, you may need to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/401980/best-cpus-for-gaming.html">upgrade your CPU</a>.</p>



<p>If you notice that graphics card bottlenecking performance, try reducing the graphics quality presets in the game first, or at least reducing more strenuous graphics effects (like ray tracing or texture quality). Activating image upscaling features like Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS, AMD&rsquo;s FSR, and Intel&rsquo;s XeSS should also help, as they render frames at a lower, more GPU-friendly resolution before using software to upscale the image back to your monitor&rsquo;s resolution. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, you can also try lowering your resolution (e.g. from 1440p to 1080p).</p>



<p>In the case of a severe GPU bottleneck, you may need to upgrade to a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">more powerful graphics card</a>.</p>

<p>PC gamers love Steam as a game launcher&mdash;and for good reason. Viewing, managing, and adding to your massive game library is easy and straightforward. The same can&rsquo;t be said about some of the launchers made by game publishers. Take Ubisoft, for example. No matter its name or iteration, the company&rsquo;s software has long drawn apathy at best and actual hatred at worst.</p>



<p>Ubisoft recently <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/45npDyJWSNathaIDK3gvLp/the-next-evolution-of-ubisoft-connect-is-here&amp;xcust=2-1-1970359-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">unveiled a brand-new take</a> on its launcher. With a fresh look and improved features, it&rsquo;s a revamp that&rsquo;s far more substantial than seen in previous years. And the beta is live now.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Ubisoft Connect (new beta version)" class="wp-image-1970361" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ubisoft-Connect-new-beta.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ubisoft says the new interface should better match the company&rsquo;s mobile companion app and in-game overlays for PC and consoles.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Ubisoft</p></div>



<p>In its in-app announcement of the rollout, Ubisoft says it rebuilt Connect completely, calling the update the &ldquo;biggest&rdquo; in over a decade. Teaser images show an interface that looks much more like the Xbox app in Windows, with streamlined sidebars, icons offering more details, and better integration of Ubisoft+ subscription content in the games library. One big improvement: You can now see the download status of your games at a glance.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>You can see more of the refreshed look in the announcement video, which also offers quick previews of social and streaming features in the app. If you&rsquo;re eager to give it a try, you&rsquo;ll have to wait for the beta rollout to reach you. Ubisoft says access is spreading &ldquo;gradually&rdquo; over the coming months. When it&rsquo;s your turn, a toggle will appear in the app that lets you switch to the new interface. </p>



<p>During the beta, Ubisoft is welcoming feedback on the changes, which might help partially repair the company&rsquo;s relationship with PC gamers. You&rsquo;ll never escape Ubisoft&rsquo;s launcher in order to play games like <em>Far Cry</em>, <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, and <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed</em> on PC, but using it should feel less painful and you can help shape that outcome.</p>

<p>Pity poor Google. That company has been working on VR technology for over a decade and it just can&rsquo;t seem to get anything to stick. First there was <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/469743/google_glasses_all_hype_or_reality_.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Google Glass</a>, an AR system so expensive and so over-promised it entered the popular zeitgeist as a famous flop, then <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/427532/google-cardboard-gets-a-vr-design-boss-as-alternate-realities-become-big-business.html">Google Cardboard</a>, a mobile VR setup so cheap you could build a headset out of an Amazon box. Now Google is shutting down &ldquo;Project Iris,&rdquo; a next-gen AR system that (according to early reports) could have rivaled the upcoming <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1942688/apples-vision-pro-rips-off-the-hololens-seven-years-later.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Apple Vision Pro</a>. </p>



<p>The internal project was shut down sometime earlier this year according to a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ar-iris-augmented-reality-smart-glasses-2023-6&amp;xcust=2-1-1971623-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Business Insider report</a>, which isn&rsquo;t a huge shock following the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://9to5google.com/2023/02/08/google-ar-head-clay-bavor-leaving-the-company-after-18-years/&amp;xcust=2-1-1971623-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">resignation of Google&rsquo;s vice president of AR/VR</a>. It had been in the works for at least three years, beginning with strategic acquisitions like the North AR hardware startup. Anonymous employees told Business Insider that Google leaders kept changing strategies and when the company tightened its belt with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1479842/google-lays-off-12000-employees-as-the-tech-industry-tightens-its-belt.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">layoffs in early 2023</a>, the entire thing was on the chopping block. </p>



<p>Google isn&rsquo;t abandoning VR/AR altogether. The report also says that an internal team is still working on software called &ldquo;Micro XR&rdquo; in conjunction with Samsung, which Google hopes can become &ldquo;the Android for AR.&rdquo; Repeating Google&rsquo;s success as the world&rsquo;s number one mobile operating system (or operating system, period, depending on how you measure it) is a lofty goal, especially given three previous failures. Internal testbed hardware for this AR system is reportedly named &ldquo;Betty,&rdquo; but don&rsquo;t expect that to result in anything that actually comes to mark it unless someone else makes it. </p>

## WD Blue SN580 NVMe SSD review: Superfast transfers, game-changing price

It&rsquo;s <em>the </em>bargain on the market at the moment, and there&rsquo;s not another drive that comes close.</p>
</div>


<p>Wow, it took a while, but thanks to WD, NVMe SSDs have finally become commodity items. Case in point: the company&rsquo;s Blue SN580, which delivers 1TB of capacity for a ridiculously affordable $50. It&rsquo;s also extremely fast in real-world tasks. Fast? Super inexpensive? We&rsquo;re guessing other SSD vendors aren&rsquo;t going to be happy. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="sn580-design-specs-and-pricing">SN580 design, specs, and pricing</h2>



<p>Physically, the WD SN580 is your standard, single-sided 2280 (22 mm wide, 80 mm long) SSD. It&rsquo;s appropriate for laptop upgrades, it&rsquo;s PCIe 4.0 x4, and uses a WD/Sandisk-branded controller and Sandisk-labeled 112-layer TLC (Triple-Level Cell/3-bit) NAND. </p>



<p>Once again, it&rsquo;s by far the least expensive NVMe SSD we seen, available in $28/250GB, $32/500GB, $50/1TB, and $110/2TB capacities (we tested the 1TB drive). These sticker prices approach <em>half </em>the costs of the competition in the 1TB and 2TB flavors. </p>



<p>Can you say &ldquo;game-changing&rdquo; five times fast? Or perhaps, &ldquo;There go the margins&rdquo; if you&rsquo;re a competing SSD vendor.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1968374" height="494" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/WD-SN580-flat.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The single NAND chip on WD&rsquo;s Blue SN580 single-sided M.2, NVMe SSD.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Of course, something&rsquo;s got to give with prices this low, but the compromise isn&rsquo;t that bad. The SN580 is warrantied for five years/or 450TBW (TeraBytes that may be Written) per 1TB of capacity. 600TBW is the bargain norm, but considering the unprecedented bang-for-buck of this drive, you shouldn&rsquo;t care. An endurance rating of 450TBW means you can write (that is, copy or save) an average of 246GB <em>per day</em> to the drive for five years.</p>



<p>WD plays up something called nCache 4.0, which, as this is a host memory buffer design, likely has to do with interfacing your device&rsquo;s memory (the host bus memory) that the drive uses for primary caching. As our recent test of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1933516/sabrent-rocket-q4-nvme-ssd-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Sabrent Rocket Q4</a> revealed a substantial uptick in HMB performance from the previous generations, I&rsquo;m assuming nCache is at least somewhat related.</p>



<p>Despite the pricing, WD bundles its SSD Dashboard to monitor the drive as well as Acronis True Image for backup. It&rsquo;s quite the package deal.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="sn580-performance">SN580 performance</h2>



<p>The SN580 is the second PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD we&rsquo;ve tested that uses host bus memory. Like the recently reviewed <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1933516/sabrent-rocket-q4-nvme-ssd-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Sabrent Rocket Q4</a>, the SN580 turned in some stellar benchmark and real world results. In fact, the SN580 bested the Sabrent in many of our tests.</p>



<p>Indeed, the SN580&rsquo;s times in transferring our 48GB small file and folder data set are bizarrely fast. It beat the former number one PCIe 5.0 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1811977/crucial-t700-nvme-ssd-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Crucial</a><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1811977/crucial-t700-nvme-ssd-review.html"> T700</a> by 23 seconds. Holy smokes! </p>



<p>Not quite believing our eyes, we took a number of extra passes at this test, and as far as we can tell, there was no monkey business going on. Apparently, SanDisk (WD&rsquo;s SSD guru) has conjured up some form of advanced transfer magic.</p>



<p></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1968177" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/WD-SN580-48GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The SN580 (the top purple bar) turned in absurdly fast 48Gb times&ndash;decimating the former champ, the PCIe 5.0 Crucial T700.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Industry scuttlebutt has it that the latest Micron NAND is simply stellar when writing in SLC mode. This NAND may be labeled Sandisk/China, but I&rsquo;m guessing it is, at the very least, a similar design that leverages the same breakthrough. </p>



<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar, SLC means a one-bit/single level cell/or write where any voltage is a one, and no voltage is zero. MLC, TLC and QLC use multiple voltage levels to represent larger numbers, but the error checking to assure the correct level is indeed written slows things down quite a bit. Running in SLC mode means the drive can go much faster.</p>



<p>Below you can see the SN580&rsquo;s CrystalDiskMark 8 numbers. The first three drives are PCIe 4.0, with the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1811977/crucial-t700-nvme-ssd-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Crucial</a><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1811977/crucial-t700-nvme-ssd-review.html"> T700</a> being PCIe 5.0. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/828399/wd-black-sn850x-ssd-review.html">SN850X</a> and T700 have DRAM cache, while, as stated, the SN580 and Rocket Q4 use host bus memory. As you can see, when it comes to NVMe and synthetic benchmarks, PCIe 5.0 rules.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1968178" height="628" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/WD-SN580-CDM-8.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Though it obviously couldn&rsquo;t match the PCIe 5.0 T700, the SN580 (the yellow bar) matched up well with the other HBM SSD. </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Our test sample of the SN580, having only 1TB of capacity, did stall out during the 450GB write, turning in the slowest time we&rsquo;ve seen on our new test bed. It&rsquo;s unlikely you&rsquo;ll write 450GB of contiguous data very often, but the slowdown is indicative of the performance you&rsquo;ll get when the drive is filled close to capacity. (For that reason, it&rsquo;s a good idea to buy an SSD with more capacity than you think you&rsquo;ll need.)</p>



<p>As you&rsquo;ll see below, the seconds piled up only toward the end when the write slowed to 500MBps. However, that is around 200MBps faster than we&rsquo;ve previously seen TLC written natively. Something has truly improved in NAND tech.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1969797" height="699" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/WD-SN580-slowdown.png" width="1024" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Once the secondary cache runs dry, the SN580 slows down to around 500MBps, which is actually fast for TLC NAND written natively.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>To be completely fair, the other 1TB SSD we&rsquo;ve written our 450GB file to recently, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1338529/adata-legend-960-1tb-nvme-ssd-review.html">Adata </a><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1338529/adata-legend-960-1tb-nvme-ssd-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Legend</a><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1338529/adata-legend-960-1tb-nvme-ssd-review.html"> 960</a>, was only two seconds faster. In its 2TB incarnation, the SN580 would turn in a much more competitive time.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1968179" height="599" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/WD-SN580-450GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Being only 1TB, the WD SN580 ran out of secondary cache before the end of the 450GB write.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Where the SN580 impressed the most was obviously in our 48GB transfers, regularly topping 3GBps, a speed formerly reached only by PCIe 5.0 SSDs.</p>



<p>Yup, our last two HBM SSDs were as dominant over PCIe 4.0 as PCIe 5.0 SSDs are over 5th gen. Of course, we haven&rsquo;t tested any HBM PCIe 5.0 drives yet, so that&rsquo;s not the full picture. It will likely be a while before bargain PCIe 5.0 drives are available, but keep an eye out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="by-grapthars-hammer-what-a-savings">By Grapthar&rsquo;s hammer, what a savings!</h2>



<p>If you get the reference, nice to know you. If not, that&rsquo;s simply a nerdy way of saying that the SN580 is a wonderfully high-performing NVMe SSD that costs a whole lot less than the competition. As long as that situation holds, the SN580 is the SDD you want at this price point.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-we-test-ssds">How we test SSDs</h3>



<p>Internal drive tests currently utilize Windows 11, 64-bit running on an X790 (PCIe 4.0/5.0) motherboard/i5-12400 CPU combo with two Kingston Fury 32GB DDR5 4800MHz modules (64GB of memory total). Both 20Gbps USB and Thunderbolt 4 are integrated to the back panel and Intel CPU/GPU graphics are used. The 48GB transfer tests utilize an ImDisk RAM disk taking up 58GB of the 64GB of total memory. The 450GB file is transferred from a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://Talking%20to%20Phison,%20it%20seems%20likely%20that%20the%20Micron%20N48%20NAND%20is%20simply%20blazing%20in%20pSLC%20mode%20(pseudo%20Single%20Level%20Cell/1-bit)%20and%20the%20E21T%20improves%20greatly%20on%20HMB%20performance.%20Whatever%20the%20reason,%20you%20get%20real%20world%20sustained%20transfers%20we&amp;#039;ve%20only%20seen%20with%20the%20latest%20PCIe%205.0%20drives.&amp;xcust=2-1-1966808-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Samsung 990 Pro 2TB</a> which also runs the OS. </p>



<p>Each test is performed on a newly formatted and TRIM&rsquo;d drive so the results are optimal. Note that in normal use, as a drive fills up, performance will decrease due to less NAND for secondary caching, as well as other factors.</p>



<p class="is-style-plain"><strong>Caveat: </strong>The performance numbers shown apply only to the drive we were shipped and to the capacity tested. SSD performance can and will vary by capacity due to more or fewer chips to shotgun reads/writes across and the amount of NAND available for secondary caching. Vendors also occasionally swap components. If you ever notice a large discrepancy between the performance you experience and that which we report, by all means, let us know.</p>

<p>Arq even sells the client separately for use with said third-party online repositories. Due to our flawless testing experience with the program, that&rsquo;s something we can actually recommend.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading:</strong> To learn about competing products, see our roundups of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407149/online-cloud-backup-services-carbonite-idrive-backblaze-livedrive.html">best cloud backup services</a> and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407021/best-windows-backup-software.html">best Windows backup software</a>.</p></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="arq-7-backup-plans-and-features">Arq 7 Backup plans and features</h2>



<p>The Arq 7 backup program on its own (single-seat, perpetual license) is a tad pricey at $49.99. But, the alternative Arq Premium subscription plan covers five seats, along with 1TB of storage, for $59.99 yearly. </p>



<p>That&rsquo;s $10 less than I&rsquo;m currently paying for OneDrive through Microsoft&rsquo;s Office 365 service. Of course, that has the Office apps, but I opted for it predominantly because it was the cheapest 1TB online storage option at the time.</p>



<p><em>Note that the client software provided with the online storage plan becomes restore-only, not perpetual, if you cancel the service.</em> <em>Additional online storage is available at $6 per TB per month.</em></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1958446" height="714" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Arq-7-Backup-pricing.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Arq&rsquo;s online service is quite reasonably priced, but we&rsquo;d like to see the client drop a few bucks.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The lengthy list of storage destinations and protocols that Arq 7 supports includes: Amazon Drive AWS S3, S3-compatible services, Glacier, Google Cloud Storage, Backblaze B2, Dropbox, Google Drive, Minio, OneDrive, SharePoint, Storj, Wasabi, SFTP,  Network volume (SMB or AFP), and direct-attached storage. Whew.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1958396" height="1152" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Arq-7-Backup-storage-locations.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="714" /><figcaption>Arq 7 Backup supports a host of destinations including most popular online storage services.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Arq 7 supports multiple jobs (or backup plans) that you can tailor to each particular service or device&mdash;e.g. you can back up just your vital documents to a free cloud service, and all your files to a more capacious account, a local hard drive, NAS box, etc. </p>



<p>The list of options supported by Arq 7 Backup is extensive: granular scheduling, network transfer throttling and interface selection, extensive retention rules, email reporting, encryption settings, immutable files (object locking), and a host of power/alert/performance options.</p>



<p>One minor nit I have with Arq 7 (and with many other backup programs) is that you can&rsquo;t assign multiple storage locations to a single backup job/plan. Most users have a single data set that they want to back up to multiple locations. There is, however, a workable alternative provided&mdash;exporting of your data selections as .json (Java Script Object Notation) data files that you can import into subsequently defined jobs/plans.</p>



<p>Another minor quibble about Arq 7 Backup is that there&rsquo;s no plain file backup option, i.e. simply copying files to another location. You need Arq 7 to restore your files from their proprietary containers (which do make many tasks easier and faster); you can&rsquo;t simply browse the destination using your OS and pull them off as you please. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>One of Arq 7&rsquo;s best attributes is its clean, concise interface. The backup chore can be intimidating to new users, so a logical, intuitive interface is welcome.</p></blockquote></figure>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1958447" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Arq-7-Backup-help.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Arq 7&rsquo;s help is copious and well-written.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Arq 7 is a bit of a one-trick pony (straight backup), though it does that trick extremely well. But there are no goodies such as partition or drive image backups, cloning, disaster recovery via boot media, sync, etc. That&rsquo;s not a dig, just an FYI&mdash;though it is why I consider the price to be a bit on the high side. </p>



<p>If you want something more versatile for local backup, try the top-ranked <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/605046/r-drive-image-review.html">R-Drive Image</a>. But for leveraging multiple online services for pure backup, Arq 7 is unique.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-arq-7-backup-interface">The Arq 7 Backup interface</h2>



<p>One of Arq 7&rsquo;s best attributes is its clean, concise interface. The backup chore can be intimidating to new users, so a logical, intuitive interface is an important consideration. </p>



<p>Arq 7 steps you through the destination and data selection, then leaves you on your own for advanced settings, offering a series of tabs with the related options. Hint: You&rsquo;re likely fine without adjusting the advanced settings. If not&hellip;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1958450" height="897" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Arq-7-Backup-interface.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Highly granular scheduling is only one of Arq 7&rsquo;s many options.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Just pretend you&rsquo;re the wizard, click on each logically arranged tab in turn, and you&rsquo;ll be okay. I promise. That said, if you&rsquo;re a complete neophyte you might want to bone up a bit on the concepts involved.</p>



<p>Various information is displayed in a tree to the left of the main window (shown below). This includes defined jobs (plans), dates of the backups, etc. There&rsquo;s a separate restore section with entries for each storage destination, though you&rsquo;ll need to drill down to the actual backup and date for the restore option to appear. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1963491" height="893" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Arq-7-Main-Interface.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>There&rsquo;s a restore section for each backup destination.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>While it may take you a while to get up to speed on Arq 7&rsquo;s workflow, once you are, it&rsquo;s extremely efficient. I&rsquo;ll take that over the kind of hand-holding that slows you down in the long run any day.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-does-arq-7-perform">How does Arq 7 perform?</h2>



<p>Arq 7 performed flawlessly in my tests. Specifically, I used Arq 7 to back up data sets to OneDrive, Dropbox, and the company&rsquo;s own storage service. I also backed up to a local SSD and my main NAS box, and again, OneDrive. All proceeded quickly, without failure, and without impacting my overall system performance unduly.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Arq 7 performance" class="wp-image-1958574" height="743" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Arq-7-Backup-performance-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Arq 7 </p>shows current performance to the right  and defined jobs to the left. </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jon L. Jacobi</p></div>



<p>Backup is a task with no room for failure and there were no glitches of any type to shake my confidence in the program. It&rsquo;s a matter of faith and Arq 7 inspired that. </p>



<p><em>Note that while I found Arq 7 particularly speedy, online backup durations always depend on the speed of your connection to the remote server.</em></p>



<p>Put succinctly, Arq 7 works, and it works very well.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-arq-7-backup-worth-it">Is Arq 7 Backup worth it?</h2>



<p>I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough how important flawless performance is when choosing a backup solution. Data safety isn&rsquo;t something to play around with, as anyone who&rsquo;s tried to restore a bad backup can tell you. </p>



<p>I rank Arq Premium top-tier as a storage service, and the standalone backup client is a boon for users of other online storage services. That said, I&rsquo;d be more emphatic about the latter if it were a bit cheaper.  </p>

<p>It took Microsoft a long time to integrate virtual desktop functions into its operating system. While virtual desktops had been established under Linux and macOS for years, they only made their way onto PCs with the release of Windows 10 in 2015. However, because many long-time Windows users are reluctant to change how they use the system, virtual desktops lead a relatively shadowy existence in the Microsoft world. And unjustly so, because their practical benefits are often overlooked.</p>



<p>For one thing, they create additional space on the screen and thus provide a better overview of all of your work. Secondly, the desktop extension makes it easier to work on different tasks&mdash;after all, different tools are needed when playing games or editing pictures. Temporary projects such as planning a trip can also be easily grouped together on an additional desktop and at the same time separated from the rest of your work. This increases convenience without user accounts or similar alternatives.</p>



<p><em>This article was translated from German to English, and originally appeared on pcwelt.de.</em></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Symbole und Bedienungsf&uuml;hrung zum Erstellen von virtuellen Desktops unterscheiden sich bei Windows 10 (oben) und 11 (darunter), Funktionen und Handhabung sind im Wesentlichen gleich." class="wp-image-1676933" height="630" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/virtuelle_desktops_in_windows_10_windows_11.png" width="927" /><figcaption><p>The icon for creating virtual desktops differs in Windows 10 (above) and 11 (below), but the functions and handling are essentially the same.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">IDG</p></div>



<p>Here we&rsquo;re going to bring the virtual desktop function out of the shadows and explain how to use it. Since the introduction of Windows 10, Microsoft has expanded the operation and possibilities of virtual desktops several times, the following explanations refer to the current versions (22H2) of Windows 10 and 11, with clear differences between the two operating systems.</p>



<p>Also, because virtual desktops cannot and should not replace multi-monitor operation, we explain the use of two or more screens at the end of this guide.</p>



<h2 class="toc wp-block-heading" id="virtual-desktops-are-essentially-a-desktop-extension">Virtual desktops are essentially a desktop extension</h2>



<p>So what exactly do virtual desktops do and how does one work with them? While usually we only talk about &ldquo;the&rdquo; desktop and mean the one desktop you&rsquo;ve used since the advent of personal computers, a virtual desktop means an additional mirrored desktop running separately but containing all of the same data as your original. Instead of squeezing all the important programs, links, and data onto one surface, you spread them over two or more. You can quickly switch between them with just the click of a mouse or a keyboard shortcut. </p>



<p>However, the term &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; is misleading in that all desktops have equal rights and are therefore of equal value in Windows 10 and 11. Therefore, Windows does not limit its number of virtual desktops. This is different from the virtual PC, where the simulated hardware is subject to considerable restrictions. </p>



<p>In practice, however, one can usually get by with just a handful of virtual desktops. It might be better to consider a virtual desktop in Windows as something of a second desktop or a desktop extension.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="virtual desktop in Windows 11" class="wp-image-1965194" height="460" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/virtual-desktop-win-11.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1000" /><figcaption>Instead of <p>&ldquo;Desktop 1&rdquo;, &ldquo;Desktop 2&rdquo; and so on, the extensions can be freely named. However, the background can only be changed in Windows 11, not in Windows 10.</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<p>To create a new desktop, click the <em>Task View</em> icon in the taskbar in Windows 10. By default, you will find it immediately to the right of the combined Search and Run box. Click on <em>+ New desktop</em> at the top left to create an additional virtual desktop. You will then see the two Windows desktops labelled &ldquo;Desktop 1&rdquo; and &ldquo;Desktop 2&rdquo; at the top.</p>



<p>In principle, virtual desktop creation works in the same way under Windows 11, but here the <em>Task View</em> icon is different, as is the location of your new desktops. The image at the top of this article clearly shows the differences between the two operating systems.</p>



<p>As soon as you have created your first additional desktop, click on the icon in the taskbar again and select one of the two desktops. It is best to try it out as you go, that way you can understand how it works more quickly. Play around here to familiarize yourself with the virtual desktop creation function. Don&rsquo;t worry, you can&rsquo;t break anything in the process, even deleting a desktop is harmless. Also, something to note is that open windows with unsaved contents are not lost, but are automatically moved to another desktop.</p>



<p><strong>Tip: </strong>If the desktop icon for the virtual desktops is missing from your taskbar, add it by right-clicking on a free space in the taskbar. Under Windows 10, select <em>Show Task View button</em>. And under Windows 11, right-click the taskbar and select <em>Taskbar settings</em>, where you will see a toggle to turn the <em>Task View</em> on.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Virtual desktops in Windows 11" class="wp-image-1965201" height="741" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Virtual-desktops.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Below, the virtual desktops in the overview; above, the open windows of the active desktop. The context menu allows various actions.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<h2 class="toc wp-block-heading" id="working-with-additional-desktops-in-practice">Working with additional desktops in practice</h2>



<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Most of the virtual desktop&rsquo;s important functions can also be quickly accessed via shortcut instead of with the mouse:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Win-Ctrl-D:</strong> Create new virtual desktop</li><li><strong>Win-Tab:</strong> Display the contents of the various desktops. Unlike Alt-Tab, the preview is retained even after the keys are released</li><li><strong>Win-Ctrl-Arrow right/left:</strong> Show contents of the next or previous virtual desktop </li><li><strong>Win-Ctrl-F4:</strong> Close current virtual desktop</li></ul>



<p>If you click on the <em>Task View</em> button and have already created at least one other desktop, Windows will highlight the current actively used desktop. As you select each desktop, you&rsquo;ll be able to see the currently open windows in that particular desktop. </p>



<p>By clicking on one of these thumbnails you can bring it to the foreground, or by dragging and dropping the window you&rsquo;re able to move it to another desktop. Clicking on another desktop will open it, while hovering the mouse over a desktop (without clicking) displays a preview of the open windows of that desktop. From this preview you can bring a running application to the foreground by clicking on it or move it back to the active desktop by holding down the mouse button. </p>



<p>It sounds complicated, but once you play around with it you&rsquo;ll notice it&rsquo;s actually quite simple and intuitive.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="other-important-virtual-desktop-settings-can-be-found-by-right-clicking-a-desktop-application-preview">Other important virtual desktop settings can be found by right-clicking a desktop application preview</h3>



<p>If you right-click on one of the running applications in the desktop overview, you can <em>Show this window on all desktops</em> or <em>Show windows from this app on all desktops</em>. So while the first option is limited to the one window, the second covers all windows of an application. </p>



<p>For example, if you work with browser windows instead of tabs, they will be available on all workspaces. You can also access standard software such as email and word processing immediately without having to switch the desktop first. These are nuances that you can adjust individually or change again at any time.</p>



<p>If you right click a desktop application preview, you can select <em>Move to &gt; &ldquo;Desktop 2&rdquo;</em> (or &ldquo;Desktop 3,&rdquo; or &ldquo;New Desktop&rdquo;), which will do the same as moving the window via drag and drop. Also, <em>Dock left</em> or <em>Dock right</em> fixes the selected window on the left or right half of the screen.</p>



<p>When using Windows 11, docking is limited to left and right&mdash;the other arrangement options (snap layouts) are not available here.</p>



<h2 class="toc wp-block-heading" id="individualizing-the-desktops-backgrounds-and-other-settings">Individualizing the desktops, backgrounds, and other settings</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Virtual Desktop" class="wp-image-1939329" height="670" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hibernate.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>In the so-called hibernation mode, Windows also preserves the contents of the virtual desktops so that they are immediately available again after the PC is started.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sam Singleton</p></div>



<p>Just as you would name hard disk folders, you should also do this for the desktops themselves. This can be done via <em>Rename</em> when you right-click on a desktop in the <em>Task View</em> menu. This will likely make navigating between desktops or projects easier than using the standard numbering by Microsoft. Under Windows 11, each virtual desktop can also be assigned an individual background, which makes it even easier to distinguish between them. Unfortunately this feature is still missing in Windows 10, although it was already implemented in various Insider builds (i.e. the pre-release versions).</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that while the operating system saves the names as well as backgrounds (Windows 11 only) of the virtual desktops, the content open on the desktop will be lost when the PC is shut down and restarted. To fix this, you can choose <em>Sleep</em> or <em>Hibernate</em> as the shutdown option under <em>Power Options</em>. In hibernation mode, the computer does not consume any power, rather the system writes the contents of the main memory to the hard disk before shutting down and reads them from there when &ldquo;switching on&rdquo; again. </p>



<p>In this way, you continue working in the same state where you left off before. If hibernation is not immediately available on your computer, activate it in the Control Panel under <em>Hardware and Sound &gt; Power Options &gt;</em> <em>Choose what the power buttons do</em>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Virtual Desktop" class="wp-image-1939322" height="667" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Multitasking-Virtual-Desktop.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p></p><p>You can set whether open windows are to be displayed system-wide or only in the active virtual desktop. </p><p></p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Sam Singleton</p></div>



<p>Finally, you can determine which icons in the taskbar should be visible when using the desktop extensions. To do this, open the Settings app of Windows and click on <em>System &gt; Multitasking</em>. In Windows 10 under <em>Multitasking</em> you can directly select the options for displaying open windows; on Windows 11, an extra click on <em>Desktops</em> is required. The setting of the second feature (<em>Alt-Tab</em>) should depend on how many windows you usually open. While the option <em>All desktops</em> offers quick shortcut access to all open applications across all desktops, the convenience of overview is quickly lost with three or four virtual desktops and too many windows.</p>



<h2 class="toc wp-block-heading" id="the-desktop-alternative-windows-in-multi-monitor-mode">The desktop alternative: Windows in multi-monitor mode</h2>



<p>Most PCs offer the option of connecting more than one monitor, either via two or more HDMI ports, USB-C, DisplayPort, VGA, or a combination of different connections. The same applies to a second monitor on the laptop, which can serve either additionally or exclusively as a large display. If you&rsquo;re using a laptop, a portable display that doesn&rsquo;t require a 230-volt power connection but receives its power from the integrated battery or via USB from the notebook is a great option if you&rsquo;re on the move and want additional desktop space. For more info about these options, see our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1787210/best-portable-monitors.html">best portable monitors</a> and check out our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">best monitors</a> for even more display options. </p>



<p>Two or more monitors can be configured in the Windows settings under <em>System &gt; Display</em>. You can read more about this process in our article for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/448298/how-to-set-up-two-monitors.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">how to set up two monitors</a>. If you decide to go with a second monitor, you should know that virtual desktops cannot currently be distributed to different screens in multi-monitor mode.</p>
