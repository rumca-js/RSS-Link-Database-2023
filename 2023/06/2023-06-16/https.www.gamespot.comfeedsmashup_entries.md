<div><p>The Flash has faced scrutiny for over a year due to a variety of legal incidents involving star Ezra Miller. The actor was arrested twice in Hawaii on harassment and assault charges, pled guilty to trespassing after being charged with burglary, and has been accused of grooming a minor, among other incidents. The minor in question, now an adult, disputes the grooming allegation. In August 2022, Miller announced they were seeking treatment for "complex mental health issues." Later, in January, The Flash studio Warner Bros. announced that they were standing behind the actor. You can read more about the issues surrounding Miller <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dcu-studios-bosses-fully-support-ezra-millers-recovery-open-to-dcu-return/1100-6511026/">here</a>.</p></div><p>DC's attempt to copy Marvel's box office domination with a shared universe of its own has been off the rails for much longer than it was on them--if indeed it ever truly was on them--and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-flash-review-fast-paced-fun-at-first-but-runs-out-of-steam/1900-6418077/">The Flash</a> has long been speculated as a way to soft-reboot the overall franchise using time travel.

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo IV's</a> Nightmare dungeons will be receiving a major buff ahead of the game's first season, Blizzard has announced.</p><p dir="ltr">In the first "fireside" chat for Diablo IV on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/diablo">Twitch</a>, game director Joe Shely discussed recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-hotfix-nerfs-dungeons-used-for-power-leveling/1100-6515203/">hotfixes that made farming normal dungeons less efficient</a> when it came to leveling up and gaining items. In order to make Nightmare dungeons, which are intended to be a key part of Diablo IV's endgame, more appealing, Blizzard will be improving the amount of XP rewarded by Nightmare dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">Part of making Nightmare dungeons more efficient overall is to reduce the amount of time it takes to travel to the dungeons themselves. As it stands now, players have to travel to the nearest waypoint and then manually run to the dungeon entrance. Blizzard in the near future will be making it so Nightmare Sigils will create a waypoint for the corresponding dungeon that players can travel to, greatly reducing travel time and making Nightmare dungeons more efficient to farm.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-nightmare-dungeons-will-be-getting-a-big-efficiency-boost-ahead-of-season-1/1100-6515304/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Phil Spencer Shares How Xbox Game Pass Differs From Netflix

<p dir="ltr">There's no question that Microsoft continues to tout Xbox Game Pass and day-one launches on the service. But Xbox head Phil Spencer was recently asked if he should be concerned with some of the struggles the TV streaming industry has faced, like subscriber losses and content bloat.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/jun/16/phil-spencer-on-the-future-of-xbox-most-people-just-want-to-find-a-great-game">The Guardian</a>--which traveled to Los Angeles for this interview thanks to Microsoft's paid accommodations--posited this question to Spencer, who responded with one clear difference between Xbox Game Pass and Netflix. "Look at the stats," he said. "The number of games that are in Game Pass relative to unique videos on Netflix is vastly, vastly different.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think we're somewhere between 300 and 400 games. It's still a lot, but we're not trying to inundate you. When I get negative feedback on Game Pass, it's when quality isn't what people expected. But then there's a marginal cost for them in trying something they would've never tried before. If there's any signal, it's how are our players feeling--how's the subscriber number going, and are creators coming back?"</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-shares-how-xbox-game-pass-differs-from-netflix/1100-6515302/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>It's the start of the weekend, and after a hard work of week, it's time to cut loose in Destiny 2's Trials of Osiris. The time-limited PvP mode is live again, and if you've been itching to earn some of the best gear in the game, then it's time to assemble a fireteam and try for a Flawless run here. As usual, you can check where Xur is before you head into Saint-14's arena to see if the salesman has any Exotic gear that can help you out. Here's a look at where you'll play Trials of Osiris this weekend and what weapons you can earn.</p><ul><li>Map: To be confirmed</li><li>Reputation Rank 4: Upgrade Module</li><li>Reputation Rank 7: Enhancement Prism</li><li>Reputation Rank 10: The Messenger (Pulse rifle)</li><li>Reputation Rank 13: Upgrade Module</li><li>Reputation Rank 16: Unexpected Resurgence (Glaive)</li><li>Flawless Reward: To be confirmed</li></ul><p>Season of the Deep is adding some excellent new rewards to the Trials pool, and if you're a fan of shaders, then there's a glorious golden one to grab from this multiplayer event. Alongside the Glorious Patina shader, Trials will also have some new Exotic cosmetic gear to unlock, including a new Ghost shell, ship, and Sparrow. Glorious Patina will only be available to players who go Flawless during Season 21, and the weapon pool is being updated with The Messenger pulse rifle and the Unexpected Resurgence glaive as possible prizes.</p><p>A new emblem has been added, but you'll need to get a Flight of the Pigeon medal for every win and open the Flawless chest at the Lighthouse to obtain it. The other big change to Trials this season is the debut of an introductory quest that provides a proper tutorial for new Trials players, and completing it will reward players with the Astral Horizon Trials Shotgun.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trials-of-osiris-rewards-this-week-in-destiny-2-june-16-20/1100-6515300/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## In Citizen Sleeper 2, Every Mechanic Strives To Have A Story-Driven Consequence

<p>The original Citizen Sleeper came out at the perfect time for me. The 2022 role-playing video game was released just as my role as the "forever GM" among my friend group was solidifying, leaving me eager for tabletop-inspired gaming experiences where I could be a player. Utilizing an action economy based around rolling dice to deliver an agency-rich roleplaying experience, Citizen Sleeper scratched that itch I was looking for. A year later, developer Jump Over The Age has announced that Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is already in development. As you can probably surmise, I'm ecstatic.</p><p dir="ltr">Like its predecessor, Citizen Sleeper 2 sees you play as a robotic individual known as a Sleeper. The game begins with you partially rewriting your programming, stopping your need to depend on the stabilizing agent that Sleepers need to regularly inject themselves with in order to survive. However, the process is interrupted, causing you to experience memory loss and suffer multiple malfunctions in your body. As your health continues to decline, you team up with a friend you no longer have any memory of and take off on a ship, jumping from location to location in order to stay one step ahead of the gang leader hunting you down.</p><p dir="ltr">Jump Over the Age is a one-person game development studio founded by Gareth Damian Martin--I sat down with them to talk about creating Citizen Sleeper 2 so soon after the release of the first game, and how this sequel will expand upon the already solid tabletop-inspired gameplay loop. Following the interview, I asked Martin about Steam Deck support and they said they're "definitely" making the game with Steam Deck in mind and that "later on, we'll definitely be announcing more platforms." For now, Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is only confirmed for PC.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-citizen-sleeper-2-every-mechanic-strives-to-have-a-story-driven-consequence/1100-6515301/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>There's not much time to grab a Father's Day gift, and if your dad happens to be a cinephile, then a few Blu-rays are a quick and easy way to make your dad feel appreciated on this special day. At Best Buy, several Blu-rays have been discounted and the selection even includes a few steelbook editions that'll look great in a collection.

<p>Xbox Game Studios boss Matt Booty has teased that Microsoft has additional film/TV projects based on its franchises in the works beyond those that have been announced. In an interview with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-1235514825/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Booty listed off upcoming projects like season 2 of the Halo TV series, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/matt-berry-in-talks-to-join-jason-momoa-in-upcoming-minecraft-movie-report/1100-6514483/">Minecraft movie with Jason Momoa</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-movie-to-be-written-by-dune-scribe-jon-spaihts/1100-6512539/">Gears of War film from Dune writer Jon Spaihts.</a> Microsoft's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-latest-trailer-casting-announcements-and-everything-we-know-about-the-prime-video-tv-show/1100-6510394/">Fallout series is also getting a TV show from Westworld's creators.</a></p><p>But beyond that? Booty said "There are some things that we've got going on as well that I can't, you know, they're not public yet, but there's a lot there."</p><p>Booty's comments came in response to a question about if Microsoft could make a film or TV adaptation of Starfield. Booty said he had nothing to announce, but said that in general, Xbox needs to make great games first.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unannounced-xbox-film-tv-adaptations-hinted-at-by-studio-head/1100-6515297/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

In order to qualify for the program, streamers must have at least 350 "recurring paid subscriptions for three consecutive months," per a <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2023/06/15/introducing-the-partner-plus-program/">Twitch blog post</a>. Those who meet that criteria will be enrolled in the Partner Plus program for the next 12 months, regardless of how many paid subs they have during those months. Any revenue earned past $100,000 will be subject to Twitch's usual 50/50 split.</p><p dir="ltr">Streamer PaladinAmber said on Twitter that Twitch had negotiated 70/30 deals with certain top performers based on the 350 sub criteria. However, the streamer said that while the deal used to be indefinite, this new program adds a 12 month cap, making it strictly worse for those who previously had it. PaladinAmber further states that Twitch should not take 50% of a streamer's income, and describes the platform as "an empty room where we have to invite, promote, create, and direct content to entice people to join and watch."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/streamer-claims-twitchs-new-partner-plus-program-was-secret-deal-already-offered-to-top-streamers/1100-6515292/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Actor and former bodybuilding champion Arnold Schwarzenegger believes he has what it takes to be president of the United States, but the bad news for him is that it won't happen.</p><p>Speaking to Chris Wallace for his Max show Who's Talking, Schwarzenegger said "of course" he could be elected president were it not for the US Constitution rule that states the president must be a natural born US citizen. Schwarzenegger was born in Austria and is a naturalized US citizen. He was governor of California from 2003-2011.</p><p>"I mean, I think the field was wide open in 2016. And I think the field is open right now. I mean, think about it right now. I mean, who is there?

"It was a miss, but how much of a miss? I want to support them to be able to keep working to deliver the game they had in mind," Booty said. Arkane Austin will still support the game in the near-future. "That is the plan right now. They are hard at work on updates and continued content for Redfall," Booty added.</p><p>In a previous interview, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-team-thought-redfall-was-going-to-perform-better-than-it-did/1100-6515175/">Booty spoke about</a> how he and management believed that the game would have had a more positive reception on launch. "Sometimes, a team can just get a little bit of tunnel vision around their game, and sometimes management can have the opposite problem where maybe they're zoomed a little too far out," he said. "And it was a case of us having indicators that the game was going to perform a certain way … we had people play the game, we had reviews, we do mock reviews, we just had indicators that it was going to perform better than it did. And I think the team was so committed to what they were building that they just had a little bit of tunnel vision."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-exec-on-redfall-it-was-a-miss-but-how-much-of-a-miss/1100-6515285/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Folks have been gradually warming up to Boruto as the anime has ramped up, but Boruto is also about ushering in a new generation of fans. That's where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/naruto-x-boruto-ultimate-ninja-storm-connections/">Naruto X Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections</a> comes in, picking up right where the 3D arena fighting series left off.</p><p dir="ltr">This new entry is a sort of "greatest hits" for the Ultimate Ninja Storm games that coincides with the 20th anniversary of the Naruto anime. It features an expansive roster of over 130 characters throughout Naruto's history and the two story modes that fuse what's old and new in the franchise. As I got hands on with this latest entry at Summer Game Fest, it brought a strong sense of familiarity while channeling that same energy I'd expect from a fast and flashy pick-up-and-play arena-style fighter--now, for a new era.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">Mechanically, Naruto X Boruto plays similarly to the previous games in the series with two players facing off in a 3D arena using basic attacks, combos, substitute dodges, and a variety of wild Jutsus. It's also a tag-fighter, with each player having a team of three characters who they can swap to during the fight. While this system lets you mix and match your favorite characters for different team compositions, what you really want to do is set yourself up for Combination Ultimate Jutsus. These were in Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, but now with a roster of characters from Boruto, we can execute a whole new variety of them. For example, I had Boruto and Kawaki attack in unison, with Kawaki helping power up Boruto's Rasengan, for a ton of damage.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naruto-x-boruto-ultimate-ninja-storm-connections-preview-an-arena-fighter-for-a-new-generation/1100-6515281/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
