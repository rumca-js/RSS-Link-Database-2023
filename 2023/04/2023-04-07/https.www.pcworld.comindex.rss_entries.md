<p>First, we kick things off with a discussion around whether 8GB of graphics card VRAM is enough these days, after <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1675637/the-last-of-us-pc-port-is-a-disaster-at-launch.html">Sony&rsquo;s disastrous <em>Last of Us </em>PC port</a> gobbled that (and more) even at 1080p resolution. Other games like <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> and <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> also suffered on 8GB GPUs recently. Are they outliers, or should we expect this to be the norm now that next-gen consoles with 16GB of (shared) RAM are the development focus for many studios?</p>



<p>Or could it just be another bad PC port like <em>Forspoken </em>and a swath of others? These terribad cross-platform performers land in our crosshairs next, as that topic&rsquo;s deeply intertwined with the 8GB conversation.</p>



<p>Next, that upcoming <em><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1676116/cyberpunk-2077-art-director-tells-us-why-path-tracing-is-no-gimmick.html">Cyberpunk 2077 RT Overdrive mode with full path tracing</a></em> looks absolutely <em>sick</em>.</p>



<p>Finally, we wrap things up by answering the nerdiest questions poised by the live audience and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://discordapp.com/invite/SGPRSy7&amp;xcust=2-2-1780649-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Full Nerd Discord members</a>, then teasing the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m6gxUzsD3A&amp;xcust=2-2-1780649-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">live PC build we&rsquo;ll be doing with Brad Shoemaker</a> on April 13.</p>

## Microsoft Edge puts Bing’s AI image generator at your fingertips

<p>Bouncing between apps and programs can become a time suck&mdash;a problem that Microsoft Edge&rsquo;s newest features want to nip in the bud. Splashiest among them is the integration of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1666493/hands-on-with-bing-image-creator-bing-chats-ai-art-tool.html">Microsoft&rsquo;s Dall-E powered Bing Image Creator</a>, which lets you generate custom AI art right within the browser.</p>



<p>Available for desktop users, Bing Image Creator generates four images for download in response to a prompt (e.g., &ldquo;smartphone with a thick case but broken screen&rdquo;). For users who&rsquo;ve had the feature roll out to them, you&rsquo;ll need to first add it to Edge&rsquo;s sidebar, or the strip of icons running along the right side of a browser tab or window. Afterward, getting started is merely a single click in the sidebar.</p>



<p>But the new Drop and image editing tools are equally helpful&mdash;if not more so. You may not craft presentations or write articles that require bespoke images, but you probably collect photos, notes, and other bits of information that you&rsquo;re sending yourself across platforms to keep track of. Edge&rsquo;s Drop feature gives you one central location to corral everything. Also accessed through the sidebar, you&rsquo;ll need to log into a Microsoft account to get started. After, you can access whatever you upload across devices.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="Edge's built-in image editor" class="wp-image-1780586" height="656" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-editor.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The image editor will scale to your browser resolution, so on a high-res monitor, this image blew up to nearly 300%. The final result was crisp when viewed at a normal 100% zoom. (Right-click and choose &ldquo;Open in new tab&rdquo; to view at full size.)</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>Meanwhile, right-clicking on images in Edge now offers a new option, <em>Edit image</em>, that opens up an in-browser overlay with the selected image. Adjustments like rotation, color filters, cropping, and more are available, with the ability to save your final product after you&rsquo;re finished with your tweaks.</p>



<p>You can read more about these features and others, including updates to energy saving settings, in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2023/04/06/edge-features-to-help-you-stay-organized-and-power-your-productivity/&amp;xcust=2-1-1780581-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Microsoft&rsquo;s blog post announcing their launch</a>. And if that&rsquo;s not enough for you, you can also dig into the preview of Workspaces in Edge, which released earlier this week and allows the creation of tab collections sharable among groups of people.</p>

<p>When I spotted these sleek Sony headphones this morning, I was floored. Not only do I love the sophisticated wireless design, but they also include Sony&rsquo;s awesome noise-canceling technology. Fortunately for you (and me), they&rsquo;re on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/314074071401&amp;xcust=2-2-1780394-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">sale for just $219.99</a> on eBay, which is a <em>massive</em> savings of $180 or 45 percent off. </p>



<p>The Sony headphones feature touch control settings, up to 30 hours of battery life, and vegan leatherette material. According to the manufacturer, this headset has two processors that control up to eight microphones, which helps cancel out environmental noise as well as mid frequency sounds. The Auto NC Optimizer function also optimizes noise cancelling performance by &ldquo;analyzing the wearing condition of the headset.&rdquo; It takes into account the shape of your face, whether or not you&rsquo;re wearing glasses (hi!), atmospheric pressure conditions, etc.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a certified refurbished unit, but don&rsquo;t fret too much over that little detail. These headphones have been refurbished by the manufacturer and they come with a two year warranty, which covers repairs and replacements.</p>



<p>This is a blazing hot deal, but you better act now. As of this writing, 8,476 units have already sold. Time&rsquo;s ticking, friends.</p>

## MSI hacked: Watch out for malicious fake software

<p>Modern corporations are under near-constant attack by malicious hackers and other digital no-goodniks, and gaming hardware makers are no exception. Such is the case for MSI, which confirmed to its customers that it&rsquo;s been the victim of a cyberattack. Though MSI is not enumerating who is responsible or what damage was done, a ransomware group has claimed responsibility and threatened to release source code and proprietary software if the company doesn&rsquo;t pay up. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/money-message-ransomware-gang-claims-msi-breach-demands-4-million/&amp;xcust=2-2-1780409-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bleeping Computer</a>, the ransomware group has posted evidence that it&rsquo;s been able to steal MSI source code, BIOS firmware, private keys, and 1.5 terabytes of other information crucial to MSI hardware. The criminals are asking for $4 million in ransom in order to stop from releasing the full cache of data to the web. While avoiding specifics, MSI warns customers not to download BIOS/UEFI files or firmware from any source except directly on MSI&rsquo;s website, indicating that compromised software in &ldquo;the wild&rdquo; is a current concern. </p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.techpowerup.com/306941/msi-warns-customers-after-cyberattack-on-its-systems&amp;xcust=2-2-1780409-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TechPowerUp</a> quotes MSI representatives who say that the company is now &ldquo;restoring its systems back to normal operations,&rdquo; and that the attack has had a minimal effect on its day-to-day business. If the company is telling the truth, customers have little to worry about so long as they practice the usual due diligence when downloading software, drivers, and updates. The recent hack is apparently unrelated to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.facebook.com/MSIGaming/posts/pfbid0r8e56YbUn8B3NYKdunapyP5xroqrepmRvAZZgLQAVcK5qp3BqtVPriht13rXcVFMl&amp;xcust=2-2-1780409-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a string of fraudulent emails</a> that began circulating in February, claiming to offer lucrative MSI sponsorships to content creators. </p>

<p>To provide thorough protection, today&rsquo;s security products must do more than just scan for viruses and malware. They need to check for harmful internet traffic, intrusive browser tracking, privacy issues, outdated software, and weak passwords, among other items. One product providing all that and more is Avira Prime for Windows.</p>



<p>Designed for all supported versions of Windows, Avira Prime packs a lot into one program. Under the banner of security, the software includes the usual virus protection but throws in a software updater and a firewall. In the area of privacy, Avira Prime provides a file shredder, an identity-theft monitor, a password manager, and an online tracking blocker. And to help boost your PC&rsquo;s performance, the program offers a driver updater, a battery saver, a duplicate file finder, a disk space optimizer, and a few other tricks.</p>



<p>Like most paid security products, Avira Prime charges a subscription rate based on the number of PCs and devices you want to protect and the length of the plan&mdash;$9.99 per month, $59.99 per year, or $189.99 for two years for five devices, and $12.99 per month, 129.99 per year, or $249.99 for two years for 25 devices. The devices protected under your chosen plan can include Windows PCs, Macs, iPhones, iPads, Android devices, and web browsers. A free 30-day trial lets you check out the full program on up to five devices.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Future reading:</strong> See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407277/best-antivirus-for-windows-pc.html">best antivirus for Windows PCs</a> to learn about competing products.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="avira-prime-installation">Avira Prime installation</h2>



<p>Installing Avira Prime is quick and simple, with just a small status window showing you the progress. After the installation is done, the program prompts you to run a smart scan to look for a variety of potential problems, including viruses, privacy concerns, performance obstacles, and outdated apps. Upon checking your system, the scan alerts you to any issues. From here, you can view more details on the issues and select the ones you want automatically fixed.</p>



<h2 id="avira-prime-features">Avira Prime features</h2>



<p>The main dashboard is well designed, organizing its tools into three different categories&mdash;Security, Privacy, and Performance. Beyond running the smart scan, you can easily drill down to each category and tool.</p>



<h3 id="security-options">Security options</h3>



<p>Under <em>Security</em>, the virus protection offers a few different types of scans. A full scan checks your entire PC, either immediately or at a scheduled frequency&mdash;daily, weekly, or monthly. A quick scan checks only certain folders and vulnerable areas immediately or at a scheduled day and time. You can also create a custom scan in which you choose the folders and the frequency. With a full or custom scan, you&rsquo;re able to specify whether malicious files should be quarantined, deleted, or ignored.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Naturally, Avira Prime offers real-time scanning with three options enabled by default. The virus protection prevents malware from trying to infect and modify files on your computer. The web-based protection tries to defend you from online threats. And the ransomware protection aims to prevent hackers from locking your device or encrypting your files.</p>



<p>Also under security is a software updater, which scans your PC for outdated applications and can automatically update them. Additionally, a firewall attempts to block malicious or suspicious apps and other activity coming through your network. You have full control over the firewall, so you can modify existing rules to allow or block specific processes, add new rules, or turn off the firewall completely.</p>

<h3 id="privacy-options">Privacy options</h3>



<p>In the area of privacy, the Avira Safe Shopping extension works with all the major browsers to keep you away from malicious sites and prevent tracking by ad networks. A built-in VPN lets you choose different locations around the world through which you can securely route web traffic. You&rsquo;re able to keep the VPN on all the time or just for certain Wi-Fi networks. Next on the list is a file shredder that will permanently delete files, thus making it harder for anyone to recover them.</p>



<p>The built-in password manager requires that you set up an account and a master password with Avira and install the required extension in Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and/or Firefox. From there, Avira will suggest and save a strong password when you create a new account and automatically enter the credentials when you need to sign in. The password manager is also available as a mobile app for iOS/iPadOS and Android.</p>



<p>Another privacy tool is an identity assistant. If enabled, this one will monitor your email address for Dark Web activity and alert you if any of your personal data has been compromised. As the icing on the cake, a privacy settings tool gathers all the Windows privacy options in a single place so you can easily manage each one. You can even choose a predefined level of privacy, and the program will apply it for you.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Avira Prime Privacy tab" class="wp-image-1684475" height="747" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/4-Avira-Prime-for-Windows-Review.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>In the privacy area are a web tracking blocker, VPN, password manger, file shredder, and identity assistant.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Avira</p></div>



<h3 id="performance-options">Performance options</h3>



<p>Finally, under the performance area is an optimizer that will free up space, clean cookies and broken Registry entries, and try to speed up your PC. The results identify junk files, downloads, and slow startup apps that you can opt to remove or fix. The battery saver displays your current battery status and lets you choose a specific power plan to better extend your battery charge. A driver updater scans for outdated drivers and offers to update any old ones.</p>



<p>A duplicate-file finder scours your PC for duplicate files and removes any you don&rsquo;t need. A game booster aims to optimize your PC if you&rsquo;re playing a full-screen game that needs more CPU, memory, and video resources. Further, the startup optimizer looks for apps and other items that can be removed from your startup routine, while a hyper-boost option analyzes and tries to shorten your startup time.</p>

<p>To cap off all the features, Avira Prime provides a detailed Settings menu where you control key options for the three different categories. There&rsquo;s also an online dashboard that shows you all the devices on which Avira Prime is installed along with access to the built-in tools, links to helpful tips and documents, and a page for customer support.</p>



<h2 id="what-is-avira-primes-performance-impact">What is Avira Prime&rsquo;s performance impact?</h2>



<p>To gauge the impact of Avira Prime on PC performance, I ran before and after benchmarking tests using the PC Mark, 3D Mark, and Procyon benchmark programs. The results showed just a minor impact on performance with Avira Prime installed, indicating that the software doesn&rsquo;t hog your system resources.</p>



<p>Trying to access the different test files from the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.eicar.org/download-anti-malware-testfile/&amp;xcust=2-2-399255-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">EICAR testing site</a> prompted the software to flag the files themselves as unsafe, preventing me from downloading them directly. I was able to download the two EICAR zip files, but when I tried to extract them, Avira blocked and quarantined them as potential threats.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/manufacturer/avira/&amp;xcust=2-2-399255-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">AV-Test reviews throughout 2022</a> awarded Avira Internet Security top marks for protection, performance, and usability. Older reviews from 2020 and earlier gave Avira Antivirus Pro high grades in the same areas. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.av-comparatives.org/vendors/avira/&amp;xcust=2-2-399255-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Reports from AV Comparatives in 2022</a> awarded Avira Prime stellar grades for protection and performance.</p>



<h2 id="is-avira-prime-worth-it">Is Avira Prime worth it?</h2>



<p>Avira Prime offers not only effective malware defenses but a host of other tools designed to protect you from both online and offline threats. In spite of all its features, the program is well designed and easy to use. For those reasons, Avira Prime is well worth the subscription price.</p>

## Google just gave browser games a huge GPU-powered upgrade

<p>Google might have <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1338418/rip-stadia-google-gives-up-its-game-streaming-ghost.html">given up on the idea</a> of streaming full-powered games to your browser window, but it&rsquo;s still invested in playing games online without the hassle of local installs. Of course it is: It makes both a browser and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/608636/best-chromebooks.html">laptops that revolve</a> around that browser. A new API called WebGPU will give remote services more direct access to your local GPU hardware, potentially allowing for full 3D games in the browser that blow current options out of the water. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://developer.chrome.com/blog/webgpu-release/&amp;xcust=2-2-1780395-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a blog post on Chrome version 113</a> (spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/6/23673462/google-webgpu-chrome-113-api-machine-learning&amp;xcust=2-2-1780395-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a>), the WebGPU tool is &ldquo;a new dawn for web graphics.&rdquo; Google says that the updated API beats out current implementations of the same idea thanks to deeper integration with GPU hardware and idiomatic JavaScript support. Future updates will include deeper access to shader cores, and the company is encouraging developers to make specific requests for new features in upcoming versions of the API. </p>



<p>While the system is exclusive to Chrome for now, support for Firefox and Safari is in the works. At the moment it works with Windows (Direct3D 12 required), ChromeOS (Vulkan required), MacOS, Linux, and Android. Unfortunately it&rsquo;s early days for WebGPU, and Google didn&rsquo;t offer so much as a tech demo to show it off. Developers will need to embrace it in a big way if it&rsquo;s going to become a significant tool. </p>

## AI chatbots aren’t search engines. They’re cryptobros

<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Over the last few months, AI chatbots have exploded in popularity off the surging success of OpenAI&rsquo;s revolutionary ChatGPT&mdash;which, amazingly, only <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1424575/chatgpt-is-the-future-of-ai-chatbots.html">burst onto the scene around December</a>. But when Microsoft seized the opportunity to hitch its wagon to OpenAI&rsquo;s rising star for a steep <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/10/microsoft-to-invest-10-billion-in-chatgpt-creator-openai-report-says.html&amp;xcust=2-3-1721988-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">$10 billion dollars</a>, it chose to do so by introducing a GPT-4-powered chatbot under the guise of Bing, its swell-but-also-ran search engine, in a bid to upend Google&rsquo;s search dominance. Google quickly followed suit with its own homegrown Bard AI.</p>



<p>Both are touted as experiments. And these &ldquo;AI chatbots&rdquo; are truly wondrous advancements&mdash;I&rsquo;ve spent many nights with my kids joyously creating <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1672975/the-best-ai-art-generators-for-you-midjourney-bing-and-more.html">fantastic stuff-of-your-dreams artwork</a> with Bing Chat&rsquo;s Dall-E integration and prompting sick raps about wizards who think lizards are the source of all magic, and seeing them come to life in mere moments with these fantastic tools. I love &lsquo;em.</p>



<p>But Microsoft and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://tech.slashdot.org/story/23/04/06/1437201/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-says-search-to-include-chat-ai&amp;xcust=2-3-1721988-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Google</a>&rsquo;s marketing got it wrong. AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Google Bard shouldn&rsquo;t be lumped in with search engines whatsoever. They&rsquo;re more like those <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Crypto%20bro&amp;xcust=2-3-1721988-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">cryptobros</a> clogging up the comments in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1381758/dont-get-scammed-why-you-cant-trust-elon-musks-twitter-right-now.html">Elon Musk&rsquo;s terrible new Twitter</a>, loudly and confidently braying truthy-sounding statements that in reality are often full of absolute bullshit.</p>



<p>These so-called &ldquo;AI chatbots&rdquo; do a fantastic job of synthesizing information and providing entertaining, oft-accurate details about whatever you query. But under the hood, they&rsquo;re actually <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model&amp;xcust=2-3-1721988-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">large language models</a> (LLMs) trained on billions or even <em>trillions </em>of points of data&mdash;text&mdash;that they learn from in order to anticipate which words <em>should</em> come next based off your query. AI chatbots aren&rsquo;t intelligent at all. They draw on patterns of word association to generate results that <em>sound </em>plausible for your query, then state them definitively with no idea of whether or not those strung-together words are actually <em>true</em>.</p>



<p>I have no idea who coined the term originally, but the memes are right: These chatbots are essentially autocorrect on steroids, <em>not</em> reliable sources of information like the search engines they&rsquo;re being glommed onto, despite the implication of trust that association provides.</p>



<p>They&rsquo;re <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://themarkup.org/hello-world/2023/01/28/decoding-the-hype-about-ai&amp;xcust=2-3-1721988-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">bullshit generators</a>. They&rsquo;re cryptobros.</p>

<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="AI chatbot showdown" class="wp-image-1722848" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ai-chatbot-showdown.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman/IDG</p></div>



<p>The signs were there immediately. Beyond all the experiment talk, Microsoft and Google were both sure to emphasize that these LLMs sometimes generate inaccurate results (&ldquo;hallucinating,&rdquo; in AI technospeak). &ldquo;Bing is powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible,&rdquo; Microsoft&rsquo;s disclaimer states. &ldquo;Make sure to check the facts, and share feedback so we can learn and improve!&rdquo; That was driven home when journalists discovered embarrassing inaccuracies in the glitzy launch presentations for <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23590864/google-ai-chatbot-bard-mistake-error-exoplanet-demo&amp;xcust=2-3-1721988-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Bard</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/14/23599007/microsoft-bing-ai-mistakes-demo&amp;xcust=2-3-1721988-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Bing Chat</a> alike.</p>



<p>Those falsehoods suck when you&rsquo;re using Bing and, you know, <em>Google</em>&mdash;the world&rsquo;s biggest two search engines. But conflating search engines with large language models has even deeper implications, as driven home by a recent <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/05/chatgpt-lies/&amp;xcust=2-3-1721988-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow"><em>Washington Post</em> report</a> chronicling how OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT &ldquo;invented a sexual harassment scandal and named a real law prof as the accused,&rdquo; as the headline aptly summarized.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s exactly what it sounds like. But it&rsquo;s so much worse because of how this hallucinated &ldquo;scandal&rdquo; was discovered.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="New Bing Chat AI interface screenshot" class="wp-image-1724844" height="876" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/new-bing.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>Yes, the Bing Chat interface says &lsquo;surprises and mistakes are possible,&rsquo; but you enter it via the Bing search engine and this design insinuates you&rsquo;ll get &lsquo;better answers&rsquo; to even complex questions despite the tendancy for AI hallucinations to get things wrong.&nbsp;</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>You should go read the article. It&rsquo;s both great and terrifying. Essentially, law professor John Turley was contacted by a fellow lawyer who asked ChatGPT to generate a list of law scholars guilty of sexual harassment. Turley&rsquo;s name was on the list, complete with a citation of a <em>Washington Post </em>article. But Turley hasn&rsquo;t been accused of sexual harassment, and that <em>Post</em> article doesn&rsquo;t exist. The large language model hallucinated it, likely drawing off Turley&rsquo;s record of providing press interviews on law subjects to publications like the <em>Post</em>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;It was quite chilling,&rdquo; Turley told <em>The Post</em>. &ldquo;An allegation of this kind is incredibly harmful.&rdquo;</p>



<p>You&rsquo;re damned right it is. An allegation like <em>that</em> could ruin someone&rsquo;s career, especially since Microsoft&rsquo;s Bing Chat AI quickly started spouting similar allegations with Turley&rsquo;s name in the news. &ldquo;Now Bing is <em>also</em> claiming Turley was accused of sexually harassing a student on a class trip in 2018,&rdquo; the <em>Post</em>&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/WillOremus/status/1643692259332743171&amp;xcust=2-3-1721988-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Will Oremus tweeted</a>. &ldquo;It cites as a source for this claim Turley&rsquo;s own USA Today op-ed about the false claim by ChatGPT, along with several other aggregations of his op-ed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d be furious&mdash;and furiously suing every company involved in the slanderous claims, made under the corporate banners of OpenAI and Microsoft. Funnily enough, an <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reuters.com/technology/australian-mayor-readies-worlds-first-defamation-lawsuit-over-chatgpt-content-2023-04-05/&amp;xcust=2-3-1721988-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Australian mayor threatened just that</a> on Wednesday, around the same time the <em>Post</em> report published. &ldquo;Regional Australian mayor [Brian Hood] said he may sue OpenAI if it does not correct ChatGPT&rsquo;s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery, in what would be the first defamation lawsuit against the automated text service,&rdquo; <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/australian-mayor-readies-worlds-first-defamation-lawsuit-over-chatgpt-content/article66702658.ece&amp;xcust=2-3-1721988-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Reuters reported</a>.</p>



<p>OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT is catching the brunt of these lawsuits, possibly because it&rsquo;s at the forefront of &ldquo;AI chatbots&rdquo; and was the fastest-adopted technology <em>ever</em>. (Spitting out libelous, hallucinated claims doesn&rsquo;t help.) But Microsoft and Google are causing just as much harm by associating chatbots with search engines. They&rsquo;re too inaccurate for that, at least at this stage.</p>



<p>Turley and Hood&rsquo;s examples may be extreme, but if you spend any amount of time playing around with these chatbots, you&rsquo;re bound to stumble into more insidious inaccuracies, nonetheless stated with full confidence. Bing, for example, misgendered my daughter when I asked about her, and when I had it craft a personalized resume from my LinkedIn profile, it got a lot correct, but also hallucinated skills and previous employers wholecloth. That could be devastating to your job prospects if you aren&rsquo;t paying close attention. Again, Bard&rsquo;s reveal demonstration included <em>obvious</em> falsehoods about the James Webb space telescope that astronomers identified instantly. Using these supposedly search engine-adjacent tools for research could wreck your kid&rsquo;s school grades.</p>



<h2 id="it-didnt-have-to-be-this-way">It didn&rsquo;t have to be this way</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="AI chatbot drinking at a bar" class="wp-image-1724145" height="835" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ai-chatbot-drinking.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption><p>AI chatbots have a big microphone and all the boistrous, misplaced confidence of that dude always yelling about sports and politics at the bar.</p>

<p>The hallucinations sometimes spit out by these AI tools aren&rsquo;t as painful in more creative endeavors. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1672975/the-best-ai-art-generators-for-you-midjourney-bing-and-more.html">AI art generators <em>rock</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1661649/forget-bing-microsoft-365-copilot-looks-like-ais-killer-app.html">Microsoft&rsquo;s killer-looking Office AI enhancements</a>&mdash;which can create full PowerPoint presentations out of reference documents you cite, and more&mdash;seem poised to bring radical improvements to desk drones like yours truly. But those tasks don&rsquo;t have the strict accuracy expectations that come with search engines.</p>



<p>It didn&rsquo;t have to be this way. Microsoft and Google&rsquo;s marketing truly dropped the ball here by associating large language models with search engines in the eyes of the public, and I hope it doesn&rsquo;t wind up permanently poisoning the well of perception. These are fantastic tools.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ll end this piece with a tweet from Steven Sinofsky, who was replying to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/katecrawford/status/1643323086450700288&amp;xcust=2-3-1721988-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">commentary</a> about severely wrong ChatGPT hallucinations causing headaches for an inaccurately cited researcher.

<p>There comes a time in many PC gamers&rsquo; lives in which they must do the previously unthinkable, and install a gaming rig in the living room.</p>



<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re working from home and can&rsquo;t stand hunching over the same desk for gaming after office hours, or you&rsquo;ve finally invested in a TV with serious gaming features such as <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394982/do-you-need-an-hdmi-21-monitor.html">VRR</a> and want a proper PC with which to use it. Or perhaps you&rsquo;ve had a taste of liberating your PC gaming library with a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1501480/master-your-steam-deck-with-these-22-tips-and-tricks.html">Steam Deck</a> and want to bring those games to even more screens around the house.</p>



<p>Whatever the impetus may be, there are several steps worth taking to prime your PC for couch use. Follow this guide, and you&rsquo;ll get a console-like, leanback experience on your gaming rig without the usual game console limitations.</p>

<h2 id="consider-a-fresh-start">Consider a fresh start</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Resetting a Windows 11 PC" class="wp-image-1666828" height="751" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/resetpc.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>If you&rsquo;re repurposing an old PC instead of setting up a new one, think about giving it a factory reset first. Clearing out whatever cruft you&rsquo;ve built up can help reduce startup times, improve performance, and free up more space to install games.</p>



<p>In Windows 10, you&rsquo;ll find reset options under <em>Settings &gt; System &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery</em>. In Windows 11, it&rsquo;s under <em>Settings &gt; System &gt; Recovery</em>. Just make sure to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/426736/3-easy-steps-anyone-can-take-now-to-back-up-a-pc.html">back up your data first</a>.</p>



<h2 id="set-your-screen-resolution-and-scaling">Set your screen resolution and scaling</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Resolution options in Windows 10" class="wp-image-1666829" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/displayscaling.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>With <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">powerful enough graphics card</a>, you can probably leave Windows&rsquo; display resolution as-is, even on a 4K TV. Some older TVs, however, can&rsquo;t output 4K at more than 30 frames per second, and older graphics cards may struggle with 4K at 60 frames per second anyway.</p>



<p>If Windows&rsquo; animations look choppy and scrolling seems sluggish, consider dropping the system&rsquo;s resolution down to 1080p instead. You&rsquo;ll get smoother performance in Windows menus, and your games will default to 1080p instead of making you dial them back from 4K.</p>



<p>To change resolution in Windows, head to <em>Settings &gt; System &gt; Display</em>, then use the Display Resolution drop-down menu. While here, you may also want to increase Windows&rsquo; display scaling so its menus don&rsquo;t look tiny. Use the &ldquo;Scale&rdquo; drop-down menu, and choose scaling of around 125% for 1080p TVs and 250% for 4K.</p>



<h2 id="set-your-refresh-rate">Set your refresh rate</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 10 refresh rate options" class="wp-image-1666830" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/refreshrate.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>After setting up resolution and scaling, the next step is to choose the smoothest refresh rate possible. On most TVs, that&rsquo;ll be 60Hz, but some newer TVs have native refresh rates of 120Hz for even smoother gameplay. (Just don&rsquo;t be fooled by the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.rtings.com/tv/learn/fake-refresh-rates-samsung-clear-motion-rate-vs-sony-motionflow-vs-lg-trumotion&amp;xcust=2-1-1666826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">artificially inflated refresh rates</a> advertised by many TV vendors.)</p>



<ul><li><strong>In Windows 10:</strong> head to <em>Settings &gt; Display</em>, select &ldquo;Advanced display settings,&rdquo; then use the &ldquo;Refresh rate&rdquo; drop-down to select the highest level possible.</li><li><strong>In Windows 11:</strong> Head to <em>Settings &gt; System &gt; Display</em>, select &ldquo;Advanced Display,&rdquo; and set &ldquo;Choose a refresh rate&rdquo; to the highest level.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Word of warning:</strong> Some TVs only offer their best refresh rates on specific inputs, so make sure your PC&rsquo;s connected to the best available input.</p>



<h2 id="use-a-fullscreen-launcher">Use a fullscreen launcher</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Playnite for Windows" class="wp-image-1666831" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/playnite.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Unless you&rsquo;re sticking with a mouse and keyboard, consider using a fullscreen game launcher for a more console-like experience.</p>



<p>Steam&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3725-76D3-3F31-FB63&amp;xcust=2-1-1666826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Big Picture Mode</a> works well if you&rsquo;re only playing games from Valve&rsquo;s storefront, but <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://playnite.link/&amp;xcust=2-1-1666826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Playnite</a> is an even better alternative. It&rsquo;s a free download that provides a single interface for all your libraries, including Epic Games, GOG, Amazon Games, Xbox, and various emulators.</p>



<p>If you go with Playnite, you&rsquo;ll have to use Fullscreen mode to navigate with your game controller. Click the controller icon, select Settings, then check the options for &ldquo;Launch in Fullscreen mode.&rdquo; Make sure &ldquo;Launch Playnite when you start your computer&rdquo; is checked as well, and the launcher will load automatically when your PC turns on.</p>



<h2 id="set-up-a-virtual-mouse-and-keyboard">Set up a virtual mouse and keyboard</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Controller Companion for Windows" class="wp-image-1666832" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/controllercompanion.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Even if you&rsquo;re using a game controller for most interactions, occasional mouse and keyboard input may be inescapable, for instance when you&rsquo;re installing games or naming your character.</p>



<p>Instead of breaking out an actual mouse and keyboard whenever this happens, consider using virtual mouse and keyboard apps instead. A couple notable options:-</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.unifiedremote.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1666826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Unified Remote</a> provides a keyboard and trackpad on your phone and connects to your PC via companion server software. The basic version is free, while a $5 upgrade supports extended keystroke commands such as Ctrl and Alt.</li><li><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=http://controllercompanion.com/&amp;xcust=2-1-1666826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Controller Companion</a> adds mouse and keyboard controls to your game controller, enabled by pressing the controller&rsquo;s Start and Menu buttons simultaneously. It&rsquo;s a $3 one-time purchase.</li></ul>



<h2 id="activate-do-not-disturb-mode">Activate Do Not Disturb mode</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Do Not Disturb in Windows 11" class="wp-image-1666833" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dnd.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t need any Windows notifications while gaming, so turn them off using Do Not Disturb mode:</p>



<ul><li>In Windows 10: Click the notification bubble, then click the Focus Assist button until it says &ldquo;Alarms only.&rdquo;</li><li>In Windows 11: Click the notification bubble, then click bell icon in the notification panel at the top.</li></ul>



<h2 id="disable-launcher-notifications">Disable launcher notifications</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Epic Games: Disabling notification options" class="wp-image-1666835" height="707" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/epicnonotifications.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Likewise, you probably don&rsquo;t want to be bothered with pop ups from various game stores while you&rsquo;re playing, especially since you can&rsquo;t dismiss them without a cursor.</p>



<ul><li><strong>In Steam:</strong> Head to <em>Steam &gt; Settings &gt; Interface</em> and disable &ldquo;Notify me about additions or changes to my games, new releases, and upcoming releases.&rdquo;</li><li><strong>In Epic Games:</strong> Click your profile icon, select Settings, then uncheck both options under &ldquo;Desktop Notifications.&rdquo;</li></ul>



<h2 id="bypass-the-lock-screen">Bypass the lock screen</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Bypassing the lock screen in Windows 11" class="wp-image-1666837" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/msusername.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>In Windows, the lock screen is a major obstacle to a controller-only setup for your living room PC. Assuming you&rsquo;ve set up your PC with a Microsoft account&mdash;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394831/mandatory-microsoft-accounts-for-windows-11-home-might-be-a-good-thing.html">which is now mandatory in many cases</a>&mdash;here&rsquo;s how to bypass the lock screen so you can jump straight into your game launcher of choice:</p>



<ul><li>Head to <em>Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-In Options</em>, then uncheck the box that says &ldquo;For improved security, only allow Windows Hello sign-in.&rdquo;</li><li>Click the Start menu button, type &ldquo;netplwiz,&rdquo; then click the top result (which should have an icon resembling two people).</li><li>Uncheck the box that says &ldquo;Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer.&rdquo;</li><li>Click &ldquo;Apply,&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll see a pop-up menu.</li><li>Under &ldquo;User name,&rdquo; enter your Microsoft account email.</li><li>Under &ldquo;Password,&rdquo; enter your Microsoft account password. Same with the &ldquo;Confirm password&rdquo; field.</li><li>Hit &ldquo;OK,&rdquo; and restart to confirm that Windows skips the lock screen automatically.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://pureinfotech.com/sign-in-automatically-bypass-lock-screen-windows-10/&amp;xcust=2-1-1666826-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Here&rsquo;s an illustrated guide</a> if you need more help with this step. Given that this will make your PC less secure, only skip the lock screen if you&rsquo;re not storing any sensitive data. (You can always reenable the lock screen in netplwiz by checking the &ldquo;Users must enter a user name and password&rdquo; box again.)</p>



<h2 id="hide-your-desktop-icons">Hide your desktop icons</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Hiding the Recycle Bin in Windows 10" class="wp-image-1666839" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/desktopiconhide.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>We&rsquo;re getting into mere aesthetic territory here, but hiding desktop icons (including the Recycle Bin) is an easy way to make your gaming PC feel more console-like. Just head to <em>Settings &gt; Personalization&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Themes&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Desktop icon settings</em>, then uncheck &ldquo;Recycle Bin.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 id="set-up-some-splash-screens">Set up some splash screens</h2>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Setting up slideshow mode in Windows 10" class="wp-image-1666842" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/slideshow.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Jared Newman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>For the final touch, set up some gaming-related wallpapers to appear on the Windows desktop. This will make for a pleasant greeting when your gaming PC boots up and&mdash;if you&rsquo;re using Playnite&mdash;in the brief moments before your game loads.</p>



<ul><li>Download some wallpapers to a single folder on your computer.</li><li>Right-click the desktop and hit &ldquo;Personalize.&rdquo;</li><li>Select &ldquo;Background.&rdquo;</li><li>Under &ldquo;Personalize your background,&rdquo; select &ldquo;Slideshow&rdquo; from the drop-down menu.</li><li>Use the &ldquo;Browse&rdquo; button to select the folder where your wallpapers are stored.</li></ul>



<h2 id="time-to-relax">Time to relax!</h2>



<p>At last, reboot your PC to make sure the entire flow is working as intended. Your computer should boot up into Windows with no distractions, automatically load your game launcher, and offer full navigation of your game catalog using only a controller.</p>



<p>The only thing left to do now is actually play something. After all this, you deserve to blow off some steam.</p>

<p>The Logitech G502, which wowed gamers back in 2014 has since evolved, culminating in the new and improved G502X. Yes, it has an upgraded 25K Hero Sensor that provides a nice boost to speed and accuracy, but the most impressive thing about the G502X is the way the buttons have been honed to near perfection. Few gaming mice, if any, have such an accessible button layout, one that invariably makes this new model one of the best all-rounder wired gaming mice you can buy in 2023.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/452384/best-gaming-mice.html">best gaming mice</a> to learn about competing products, what to look for in a gaming mouse, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>



<h3 id="logitech-g-502x-design">Logitech G 502X: Design</h3>



<p>The right-handed G502X looks to be a mirror image of its predecessor the G502 Hero, save for a few missing grooves on its back end. But if you zoom in closer, some very exciting improvements are revealed.</p>



<p>For one, the 502 Hero&rsquo;s plastic thumb rest has been replaced by rubber, which makes it a much grippier mouse and also a lot easier to clean. My wired version of the 502X also has a new rubber cord, which slid more effortlessly over my tabletop than the 502 Hero&rsquo;s braided cord that tended to catch occasionally.</p>



<p>But it&rsquo;s the buttons that really blew my mind. You still get all 13 programmable options, including DPI up/down buttons, a trigger button, a four-button mouse wheel, two buttons behind the mouse wheel and two buttons on the left. But the trigger button is now nearer your thumb which makes it so, so much easier to reach. Insta-sniping anyone? Absolutely!</p>

<p>This button is kind of a big deal to me&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing remotely as well-placed in any rivals for letting off that one must-hit command or macro that&rsquo;s vital to me performing well. Logitech G have ingeniously made it detachable too&mdash;which would&rsquo;ve been the ideal opportunity to add in some swappable triggers of varying lengths, but sadly you just get the one. Still, there&rsquo;s always the chance we&rsquo;ll see add-ons down the line.</p>



<p>The DPI buttons, G7 and G8, are also longer and easier to find than previously, which I thought might cause some misclicking on my part, but not so. In fact, there&rsquo;s excellent separation along the top left, such that I never found my fingers straying.</p>



<p>Looking at weight, and the 502X clocks at 89 grams, which is a lot heavier than ultra-lightweight mice like the 59-gram <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/792405/hyperx-pulsefire-haste-wireless-gaming-mouse-review.html">HyperX Pulsefire Haste</a>. I usually like to recommend gamers go for something lighter and quicker for the fastest FPS games in particular.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>My fingers were so well surrounded by buttons that at times it felt like I was at the helm of some kind of advanced fighter jet.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Yet for a mouse with 18 buttons, it&rsquo;s actually pretty decent and still feels quick off the mark. It&rsquo;s exactly the same weight as the 18-button <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/701156/steelseries-aerox-9-wireless-gaming-mouse-review.html">SteelSeries Aerox 9</a> too, if you want a like-for-like comparison.</p>



<p>The 502X is also very well sized. It measures 5.17 x 1.62 x 3.12 inches, so it&rsquo;s fractionally longer than its predecessor, but consequently a better fit for larger hands. It also works like a dream for all the three major grip types, although palm and claw grippers will feel the most at home thanks to the 502X&rsquo;s rather tall top.</p>

<p>There are no surprises when it comes to styling&mdash;it looks just like the G502 Hero, like some kind of a futuristic spaceship. It also comes in the same attractive, black and white colors options. The one thing missing, in my view, is proper RGB lighting&mdash;it has just a tiny DPI RGB indicator at the front. Still, if RGB is a non-negotiable, the 502X&rsquo;s stablemate the 502X Plus should do the job. It costs $159.99&mdash;considerably more than our review unit&rsquo;s $70 sticker.</p>



<h3 id="logitech-g502x-performance">Logitech G502X: Performance</h3>



<p>For some time now Logitech&rsquo;s G502 branded mice have been praised as having some of the best performance hardware you get, but competition is stiffer in 2023 and there&rsquo;s now a heap of excellent gaming mice with comparable sensors and performance out there. Some, like the $49 <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1525656/keychron-m3-gaming-mouse.html">Keychron M3</a>, you can even pick up for peanuts.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s through this lens that we need to look at the Logitech G502X&rsquo;s Hero 25K sensor, which doesn&rsquo;t redesign the wheel, but is still one of the best in the business. It tracks movement on a sub-micron level and gives you a resolution of between 100 to 25,600 DPI, maximum speed of 400 IPS (inches per second) and acceleration of 40G.</p>

<p>Taking the G502X for a spin in the FPS game<em> Insurgency</em> proved it to be an extremely proficient mouse. It tracked my movement quickly and flawlessly, without a hint of lag or stuttering. Switching up DPIs to a maximum of 25,600 DPI and things get fast&mdash;very fast. In fact, I could pan left and right with a mere twitch of my hand, yet I didn&rsquo;t see any smoothing or stuttering in the motion.</p>



<p>The 502X is also very comfortable, it kept my hand tucked cozily into its slender grooves, which also gave me pinpoint control of movement. But it was the buttons that really elevated this mouse among the vanguard of wired gaming mice for me. They feature Lightforce hybrid optical-mechanical switches that actuate instantly but feel satisfyingly tactile.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Logitech G502X" class="wp-image-1666982" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Trigger.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The new improved positioning of the trigger button on the G502X&rsquo;s left side makes firing off that must-hit command quicker than ever.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>Additionally, with a whole 18 buttons to program in Logitech&rsquo;s G Hub software app, I had enough commands to satisfy any game in my library. But it was the improvements to both the size and placement of key buttons that really made the biggest difference to my play. My fingers were so well surrounded by buttons that at times it felt like I was at the helm of some kind of advanced fighter jet.</p>



<p>The benefits of this were particularly evident when sniping. The new improved positioning of the trigger button right near my thumb, for example, helped overcome the slight speed delay I sometimes experience between targeting and firing. I found I could let loose shots in double the time, which to be honest, did wonders to boost my enjoyment. </p>



<p>The DPI up / down buttons were also worth their weight in gold, allowing me to switch quickly between my two favorite DPI settings without toggling through every single setting. That one feature alone has to be worth at least a quarter of the Logitech G502X&rsquo;s $70 price. </p>



<p>A very minor point is that if you or your friends or family need absolute quiet, the scroll wheel does tend to be quite loud at times. But this never bothered me much and takes nothing away from the fact this mouse is a class act on just about all fronts. </p>



<h3 id="should-you-buy-the-logitech-g502x">Should you buy the Logitech G502X?</h3>



<p>The Logitech G502X&rsquo;s pro-grade sensor gives you very accurate and precise tracking, but yet that&rsquo;s not so hard to find in gaming mice these days.</p>



<p>Where the G502X truly shines is in its most useful buttons, which Logitech G have tweaked since the G502 Hero to make larger and more accessible. It means the G502X quite possibly has the best all-rounder button setup you can get anywhere. For that reason, the G502X should be somewhere near the top of your list when choosing a pro-grade wired gaming mouse.</p>
