<p>If you didn&rsquo;t already believe that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394029/how-to-create-strong-secure-passwords.html">weak passwords could be cracked easily</a>, artificial intelligence is here to prove the point definitively. An AI-driven tool cracked over half the passwords fed to it in under a minute&mdash;and 65 percent in under an hour.</p>



<p>The experiment, which was run by cybersecurity firm Home Security Heroes, involved PassGAN, a new kind of password cracker. Unlike typical password cracking tools, which lean on fixed data sets, PassGAN is driven by two neural networks: one taught to generate passwords, and the other taught to distinguish between the the first&rsquo;s &ldquo;fake&rdquo; passwords and passwords taken from real data breaches. As it&rsquo;s trained, this kind of generative adaptive network learns to offer more sophisticated password predictions, allowing for faster and widespread cracking.</p>



<p>For Home Security Heroes&rsquo; test, PassGAN was fed over 15 million passwords from the 2009 RockYou breach, a data set often used to train password cracking tools. Passwords under four and over 18 characters were excluded. In no surprise to anyone, passwords with low character count and little character variation were cracked instantly. But even slightly more complex passwords could be determined much quicker. If simple enough, an 11 character password also fell immediately. Overall, the tool was able to crack 51 percent of common passwords in under a minute, 65 percent in under an hour, 71 percent in a day, and 81 percent in a month.</p>

<p>Based on their findings, Home Security Heroes offers several pieces of advice, two of which are repeats often said by security experts (and those who report on security, ahem). First, don&rsquo;t reuse passwords. Second, change your passwords every so often, especially for hacked websites. Finally, use passwords at least 15 characters in length, with a mix of at least two letters (upper and lower case), numbers, and symbols in the string&mdash;and don&rsquo;t follow any obvious or predictable password patterns.</p>

<p>You can read more about Home Security Heroes&rsquo;s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.homesecurityheroes.com/ai-password-cracking/&amp;xcust=2-1-1782671-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">findings in their blog post</a>, but the biggest takeaway just may be how much randomness in a password can affect cracking time. We at PCWorld have said for years (and will keep saying!) to use long, random, and unique passwords for each site, but this experiment drives the point home. Home Security Heroes says that a password with 18 lower and upper case letters, symbols, and numbers would take 6 <em>quintillion </em>years to guess. (A quintillion is one-billion billions, so in other words, that&rsquo;s a six followed by a heck of a lot of zeros.)</p>



<p>However, that&rsquo;s <em>right now</em>. An 18-character password likely won&rsquo;t solve our security needs forever. AI models learn rapidly&mdash;you&rsquo;ve probably seen how other applications that use artificial intelligence (i.e., <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1672975/the-best-ai-art-generators-for-you-midjourney-bing-and-more.html">AI-generated art</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1681251/10-awesome-things-you-can-do-with-chatgpt.html">AI chat bots</a>) are growing in leaps and bounds. Just imagine that applied to data from never-ending hacks. The only way to stay secure is by employing the strongest passwords you can manage&mdash;and there&rsquo;s help for that in the form of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">password managers</a>. Not only can they generate random, unique passwords for you, but they&rsquo;ll help change your credentials when it&rsquo;s time to yet again step up your password strength. Be sure to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1376010/how-to-use-two-factor-authentication-to-lock-down-your-accounts-the-right-way.html">turn on two-factor authentication</a> wherever you can, too, just in case your password does go down.</p>

<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&rsquo;s Overdrive Mode with full-blown path tracing (rather than select ray-traced effects) dropped this morning as a technology preview in the game. As expected, it&rsquo;s stunningly beautiful, and it will absolutely melt <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/416006/the-best-graphics-cards-for-pc-gaming.html">your graphics card</a>&mdash;unless you&rsquo;re running a modern GeForce RTX 40-series GPU, that is. Even then, it can be rough sledding, as our benchmarks show.</p>



<p>Nvidia worked with CD Projekt Red to create Overdrive Mode, which showcases the glorious experience that moving to fully path traced visuals can provide. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> already looked stunning. With Overdrive Mode, it&rsquo;s drop-dead gorgeous. </p>



<p>Full-blown path tracing is <strong>extraordinarily</strong> strenuous on graphics cards. There&rsquo;s a reason that it was reserved for the likes of <em>Minecraft, Quake II</em>, and <em>Portal 2</em> up until now. But ray tracing and AI advancements that Nvidia baked into the bones of the RTX 40-series&mdash;namely <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/improve-shader-performance-and-in-game-frame-rates-with-shader-execution-reordering/&amp;xcust=2-1-1782490-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Shader Execution Reordering</a> and the AI-supercharged DLSS 3 Frame Generation&mdash;allows GeForce&rsquo;s latest and greatest cards to run <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> in path-traced glory.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html#toc-5">How DLSS 3 uses AI to supercharge gaming frame rates</a></p></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>You <em>need</em> that 40-series grunt, too. In its release notes for the patch that added Overdrive Mode (along with Nvidia DLAA, Intel XeSS, and a revamped benchmark screen), CD Projekt Red says &ldquo;it requires the highest-performing hardware available to run it properly.&rdquo; Only the RTX 40-series lineup is technically supported, along with last-generation&rsquo;s RTX 3090 flagship&mdash;and that former titan is only rated to hit 30 frames-per-second at 1080p resolution, per CDPR. Gross. Wonderfully gross!</p>



<p>Other users have discovered that Overdrive Mode actually runs on other graphics cards&mdash;even <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://twitter.com/HardwareUnboxed/status/1645790014419378182&amp;xcust=2-1-1782490-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">integrated Radeon graphics in Ryzen chips</a>!&mdash;but the new feature brings even AMD&rsquo;s flagship Radeon RX 7900 XTX to its knees.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>And that&rsquo;s with FSR 2, AMD&rsquo;s DLSS rival, active. Oof.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the morning playing around with <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&rsquo;s Overdrive mode on all of Nvidia&rsquo;s current RTX 40-series cards, to give you an idea of what to expect in terms of performance when you flip path tracing on. Here&rsquo;s a video showing what it looks like:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>You&rsquo;ll find <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> Overdrive Mode performance results for the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html">$1,600 GeForce RTX 4090</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1379747/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-tested-5-things.html">$1,200 RTX 4080</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1444726/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-review.html">$900 RTX 4070 Ti</a> below. They were all tested on our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html#toc-2">usual GPU benchmarking system</a>, which runs on a Ryzen 9 5900X processor paired with 32GB of memory.</p>



<p>We <em>only</em> tested with Overdrive Mode active, at both 1440p and 4K resolutions, using the new Overdrive preset. Playing the game without path tracing enabled results in much higher frame rates, as our previous GPU reviews show. We then tested the game with DLSS on and manually set to Performance mode. (You can get slightly higher frame rates using Ultra Performance mode, but it made the upscaled image look terribly aliased and glitchy in our testing. Performance looks fine). Finally, we flipped on DLSS 3 Frame Generation as well to see just how fast this puppy can go.</p>



<p>Here are the results:</p>

<p>Nvidia and CDPR aren&rsquo;t joking when they say <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&rsquo;s Overdrive Mode can bring even these monstrous GPUs to their knees. Without DLSS active, even the RTX 4090 struggles to spit out <em>20</em> frames-per-second at 4K, with the 4070 Ti hitting single digits. Ouch. Flipping on DLSS Performance mode alone gets you to the 60fps gold standard at 1440p resolution, but these results drive home a harsh truth: You need DLSS Frame Gen to hit smoothly playable frame rates in Overdrive Mode, especially at 4K resolution.</p>

<p>That said, if you&rsquo;re a fiend for drool-worthy gaming pics, CDPR tossed you a bone. From the patch notes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&ldquo;For other ray-tracing-capable PC graphics cards with at least 8GB VRAM, we included an option to render path-traced screenshots in Photo Mode. This is possible because it means rendering just one frame, as opposed to rendering several frames every second (i.e. FPS), which would happen when playing the game&hellip;</p><p>If your graphics card has more than 8GB VRAM and this option is still greyed out, it means you need to lower your in-game resolution. Note that the higher the resolution and the less powerful the GPU is, the longer it will take to take a screenshot (between a few seconds to several minutes). You can enable Path Tracing for Photo Mode in Settings &gt; Graphics in the Ray Tracing section.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>



<p>So, there you have it. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&rsquo;s redemption story continues with Overdrive Mode, one of the most truly impressive technical feats ever pulled off in gaming graphics. Driving around Night City for a bit made my jaw drop&mdash;and my graphics card sweat. If you have an Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-series GPU, you absolutely need to see it in action.</p>



<p>Just remember to flip on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html#toc-5">DLSS 3 Frame Generation</a>!</p>

## Windows Defender finally squashes Firefox bug that ate CPUs for 5 years

<p>Firefox has a reputation of being something of a resource hog, even among modern browsers. But it might not be entirely earned, because it looks like a CPU bug affecting Firefox users on Windows was actually the fault of Windows Defender. The latest update to the ubiquitous security tool addresses the issue, and should result in measurably lower CPU usage for the Windows version of Firefox. </p>



<p>According to Mozilla senior software engineer <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1441918#c84&amp;xcust=2-1-1782236-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Yannis Juglaret</a> (via <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-finally-fixes-5-year-old-windows-defender-high-cpu-bug-on-mozilla-firefox/&amp;xcust=2-1-1782236-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Neowin</a>), the culprit was MsMpEng.exe, which you might recognize from your Task Manager. It handles the Real-Time protection feature that monitors web activity for malicious threats. The bug was causing Firefox to call on the service much more frequently than comparable browsers like Chrome or Edge, resulting in notable CPU spikes. Said CPU spikes could reduce performance in other applications or affect a laptop&rsquo;s battery life. </p>



<p>The issue was first reported on Mozilla&rsquo;s bug tracker system <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1441918&amp;xcust=2-1-1782236-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">way back in 2018</a> and quickly assigned to the MsMpEng service, but some more recent and diligent documentation on the part of Juglaret resulted in more swift action from Microsoft&rsquo;s developers. The patched edition of Windows Defender is now rolling out to Windows 10 and Windows 11 users, and should hit all of them (unless they specifically block the update) within the next week or two. </p>

<p>The wireless Logitech G733 Lightspeed is a very attractive headset, but not in a plush, luxurious kind of way&mdash;more of a casual way befitting the headset&rsquo;s $149.99 base price tag. How so? There&rsquo;s no plush leatherette or metal to be seen, but the cups are sculpted with tight angles to bestow a futuristic look and RGB lighting ripples down the front side in two neat grooves.</p>



<p>It comes in four colors, each with its own unique styling&mdash;there&rsquo;s a stately black, vibrant white, pretty pink, and my review unit&rsquo;s blue color, which features contrasting electric/navy hues and a stretchy headband with awesome &ldquo;glitch&rdquo; styling.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Note: See our roundup of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/820791/best-wireless-gaming-headsets.html">best wireless gaming headsets</a> to learn about competing products, what to look for in a wireless gaming headset, and buying recommendations.</em></p></blockquote>



<h3 id="logitech-g733-lightspeed-design-and-build">Logitech G733 Lightspeed: Design and build</h3>



<p>Despite looking like &ldquo;the bomb,&rdquo; a few drawbacks do present immediately. For one, the all-plastic headband feels a little too flimsy. That wouldn&rsquo;t have been a problem if the G733 folded down into a streamlined, satchel-friendly unit, but the earcups don&rsquo;t swivel and the headset&rsquo;s band is quite big, so it fits awkwardly alongside your other possessions in bags.</p>



<p>Additionally, the notch-less slide mechanism in the G733&rsquo;s band doesn&rsquo;t extend all that much, so it won&rsquo;t fit everyone&rsquo;s head perfectly. The G733&rsquo;s detachable microphone only measures a teeny 6mm (less than a quarter-inch), so it doesn&rsquo;t stretch across your mouth, nor will it stay in any position, so finding consistency in voice chats is also a little hard to do.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Gaming with the G733 was still absolute pleasure. The headset drummed up immersive soundscapes in current favorite games like <em>Elden Ring</em> that had me glued to the action.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The G733&rsquo;s design is somewhat redeemed by other, more flattering features, like its light weight of only 278 grams (9.8 ounces). This makes it only slightly heavier than the impressively light 252-gram (8.8 ounce) <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1339856/asus-rog-strix-go-core-moonlight-white-review-a-lightweight-portable-gaming-headset-with-easy-connectivity.html#:~:text=Our%20Verdict%20The%20Asus%20ROG%20Go%20Core%20Moonlight,but%20delivers%20natural-sounding%20gaming%20audio%20all%20day%20long.">Asus ROG Go Core Moonlight White</a>.</p>



<p>The clamp pressure is also excellent, and comparable again to another recent headset we reviewed for gamers, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1656528/nacon-rig-800-pro-hx-gaming-headset-review.html">Nacon Rig 800 Pro HX</a>. That being the case, the G733 is ideal for gaming marathons where you simply can&rsquo;t muster up the willpower to drag yourself away from your game.</p>



<p>The mesh covered earcups, too, are far more practical than leatherette ones&mdash;they&rsquo;re perfect for hot, uncomfortable days when you know you&rsquo;re going to work up a sweat. The dual-layer memory-foam cups are remarkably soft, and the funky headband always keeps the pressure off the top of your head&mdash;so well-done to Logitech G for incorporating it.</p>

<h3 id="logitech-g733-lightspeed-connectivity">Logitech G733 Lightspeed: Connectivity</h3>



<p>Sometimes simplicity trumps fanciness and connecting the G733 is child&rsquo;s play. There&rsquo;s no mucking about with multiple dongles or adapters; you simply plug the Logitech Lightspeed 2.4GHz dongle into your PC, Mac, or PlayStation 4 console, turn it on and <em>voil&agrave;</em>, you&rsquo;re off.</p>



<p>The one and only dongle in the box is a USB Type-A receiver, which is a little on the bulky side, but it does give you a reliable connection. Logitech claims the signal reaches up to 20 meters away, which saw me making long, slow, Darth Vader-like marches all the way from my desk to the kitchen in the PCWorld offices to test it. The result? It will certainly go the distance and manages to keep static and distortion under control quite well too.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Logitech G733 Lightspeed headset" class="wp-image-1674721" height="900" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Logitech-G733-Lightspeed-and-dongle.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The G733 features  2.4GHz low -latency wireless connectivity.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>That long-range audio comes in handy if you&rsquo;re listening to audio from your PC because the G733 can&rsquo;t connect to your phone, so switching your audio over for roaming about sadly isn&rsquo;t an option.</p>



<p>You do, however, get excellent battery life&mdash;Logitech claims up to 20 hours with the RGB lighting on in the default setting, or up to 29 hours when you switch it off. I didn&rsquo;t quite have my headset long enough to flatten my battery, but after 15 hours of play with RGB switched on I still had 24 percent of my battery life remaining, so it&rsquo;s quite decent.</p>

<h3 id="logitech-g733-lightspeed-controls-and-software">Logitech G733 Lightspeed: Controls and software</h3>



<p>With the G733&rsquo;s on-ear controls consisting of just a power button, volume wheel, and mute-mic button, you&rsquo;ll need to download the Logitech G Hub software if you intend on digging deeper into the headset&rsquo;s more complex functionality.</p>



<p>Here, you can preside over an impressive level of customization, including modifying your EQ settings and Lightsync RGB colors and effects. You can even tweak the volume levels of individual directional fields for the G733&rsquo;s DTS Headphone: X 2.0 surround sound.</p>



<p>G Hub also includes some useful custom presets, named for what they&rsquo;re predominantly for. For example, I made good use of the Bass Boost preset to really emphasize explosions in <em>Battlefield I</em>, and the FPS preset for hearing footsteps better in <em>Insurgency</em>, and both worked really well.</p>



<p>Blue Vo!ce is another neat feature in G Hub worth playing around with, especially if you do a lot of streaming or professional gaming. It&rsquo;s basically a bunch of voice filters that transform your voice from its natural (sometimes cringe-worthy) default state into a cleaner, more authoritative, broadcaster version that you will rather fancy hearing.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Logitech G733 Lightspeed" class="wp-image-1674754" height="896" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-29-135909.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>The Blue Vo!ce feature in Logitech&rsquo;s G Hub app modifies your voice to sound better for broadcasting and gaming chat.&nbsp;</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>It&rsquo;s easy to do and G Hub has a record and playback feature that lets you listen to the changes you&rsquo;ve made, so you can hear differences straight away, without having to load up any other program.</p>



<h3 id="logitech-g733-lightspeed-audio-performance">Logitech G733 Lightspeed: Audio performance</h3>



<p>The G733&rsquo;s Pro-G 40mm audio drivers impressed me right off the bat, producing a clean sound that seemed to jump right out of the cups. The G733 also has a decent tonal range, with respectable bass, but also full-sounding mids and highs that I applauded most of the time, and noticed was just a tiny bit flatter than some more premium headsets at other times.</p>



<p>That said, gaming with the cans on was still an absolute pleasure. The headset drummed up immersive soundscapes in current favorite games like <em>Elden Ring</em> that had me glued to the action. As Hollywood director Steven Spielberg has alluded to in the past, sound and music can make up more than half of communicating a story, and that rang true for me in my playtesting&mdash;especially watching cut scenes that the G733 really did justice to.</p>



<p>But those first impressions were just a warmup really, because the spatial audio was even more impressive. Logitech&rsquo;s decision to go with DTS headphone: X 2.0 over the popular Dolby Atmos, comes with both pros and cons.</p>



<p>On the upside, DTS has a higher bit rate than Dolby Atmos, and has consequently become somewhat of a favorite among audiophiles and pro gamers. However, the concession here is that DTS Headphone X isn&rsquo;t as widely supported among games and other media as Dolby Atmos is. Indeed, comparing my games library with a list of supported titles only revealed a few matches&mdash;like <em>Metro Exodus</em> and <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="Logitech G733 Lightspeed" class="wp-image-1674755" height="788" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Surround-sound.png?w=1200" width="1056" /><figcaption>You can assign volumes for spatial audio directions in the Logitech G Hub app.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Dominic Bayley / IDG</p></div>



<p>Still, what I heard in these games made me hope that situation changes soon; the audio was loud and clear and had excellent directionality. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that the G733 sports the latest iteration of the DTS software&mdash;version 2.0&mdash;which includes a few sweetener enhancements, including to the bass, which means you&rsquo;re getting the very best currently available.</p>



<p>My only nit-pick when it comes to the G733&rsquo;s audio performance is its noise cancellation, or lack thereof. It relies entirely on passive noise-blocking from its cups. That mostly works well to block out sounds in the lower tonal range, but a high-pitched leaf blower was quite audible in one of my playtests, so if you need absolute pristine audio all the time, the G733 won&rsquo;t fit the bill.</p>



<h3 id="should-you-buy-the-logitech-g733-lightspeed">Should you buy the Logitech G733 Lightspeed?</h3>



<p>On balance, the Logitech G733 ticks enough boxes to be a fine headset for gamers and streamers. The audio is clear and defined, it has excellent companion software, as well as robust spatial audio support. It also feels very comfortable and looks attractive in an unassuming kind of way.</p>



<p>Sure, it makes concessions in the design department, the biggest being that the band feels a bit flimsy, but if you keep this headset close to home and out of danger, its sure to last you just as long as any other.</p>

## Thunderbolt displays are tomorrow’s laptop docking station

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>Thunderbolt displays may be the future of PC I/O expansion for one very simple reason: They could save you money as well as space.</p>



<p>The very nice people at BenQ sent over the PD3220U display months ago (apologies, BenQ PR) and it sat next to my workspace while I added to our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393714/best-thunderbolt-docks-for-a-laptop-pc">ongoing list of the best Thunderbolt docks</a>. As anyone who owns a Thunderbolt dock understands, they add valuable port expansion slots to your laptop, but with two critical downsides: more snaking cords, and the dock itself takes up desk space. </p>



<p>So what does this have to do with a Thunderbolt display? <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394346/should-you-buy-a-thunderbolt-display-pros-cons-and-what-to-buy.html">It&rsquo;s our belief </a> that a well-designed Thunderbolt display like the PD3220U eliminates the need for a discrete Thunderbolt dock! Honestly, it&rsquo;s debatable whether this will save you that much money&mdash;on one hand, the dock logic is built into the display, meaning you&rsquo;re paying for it. On the other hand, you&rsquo;re buying a single device, eliminating cost overhead and saving valuable space on your desk, too.</p>



<p>BenQ&rsquo;s PD3220U is a 4K, 60Hz Thunderbolt 3 dock, designed for content creators, and covering almost 100 percent of the DCI-P3 and RGB color gamuts. BenQ sent us the 31.5-inch TFT model for our impressions. The port selection is fairly solid: a pair of HDMI 2.0 inputs, one DisplayPort 1.4 input, one 10Mb/s USB-C port, and three 10Mb/s USB-A ports, too, plus a headphone jack. BenQ even throws in a small Microsoft Dial-like hockey-puck controller that can be used to adjust color, sound, and inputs, and takes its own USB-B (yes, Type B) input.</p>

<p>What makes this monitor special, though, is its pair of Thunderbolt 3 ports. I set my review docks to the side and simply plugged in my laptop from the display&rsquo;s included Thunderbolt 3 dock&mdash;and just like that, I was up and running on the PD3220U and a second 4K display.</p>



<p>But wait&mdash;there <em>is</em> one major shortcoming that the BenQ PD3220U (and, we imagine, most other Thunderbolt displays) offers. With a Thunderbolt dock, all of the ports are readily accessible. With the PD3220U, all of the ports are aesthetically hidden behind the display. Even with a full 60 degrees of swivel adjustment (or rotating the display 90 degrees, which is recommended), it&rsquo;s just not that simple to connect a mouse, USB key, SSD, or other peripheral, and repeatedly manhandling the 23.6-pound PD3220U to do so, adds to your monitor&rsquo;s wear and tear. </p>



<p>While the display does have a side-mounted I/O pod (one USB-C port, one USB-A port, and the headphone jack), it&rsquo;s also somewhat awkward. Display makers may have to rethink favoring aesthetics over ease of use.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="BenQ PD3220U Thunderbolt display I/O port pod" class="wp-image-1683152" height="1088" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/BenQ-display-side-pod.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The PD3220U&rsquo;s side-mounted I/O port pod.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>On the other hand, the PD3220U supplies 85W of charging power, and the second Thunderbolt port allows you to daisy-chain displays. While this is an appeal to a Mac audience, Windows users shouldn&rsquo;t despair: just buy a Thunderbolt-to-DisplayPort cable if your second display supports Thunderbolt. Connect that cable from the second Thunderbolt output from the BenQ PD3220U to the other display, and you&rsquo;ve solved that problem. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m left thinking several things: first, I&rsquo;m an idiot for not testing this sooner. Second, the heck with aesthetics. I can still remember when display makers slipped the ports underneath the <em>front</em> of the display, rather than hiding them at the back. I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of function over form, and I&rsquo;d much rather see a cable than have to wrestle a big awkward display around just to connect a USB key. Also, imagine fumbling around by feel in order to plug in your USB-A mouse.</p>



<p>As much as I might presently favor the flexibility of Thunderbolt docks and our related list of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/402858/the-best-usb-c-hubs-for-your-laptop-tablet-or-2-in-1.html">the best USB-C hubs and dongles</a>, I can&rsquo;t help but think that this approach might eventually be the way forward. If manufacturers can get the cost down (and somehow convince consumers that they&rsquo;re actually <em>saving</em> money by buying a more expensive monitor), a central docking station, done right, makes a lot of sense. Desktops are chock-full of I/O options, and svelte, elegant laptops always feel a little cheated in that regard.</p>



<h2 id="a-quick-test-of-the-benq-pd3220u">A quick test of the BenQ PD3220U</h2>



<p>The BenQ PD3220U put out just 180 nits at maximum brightness, which differed fairly significantly from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.displayninja.com/benq-pd3220u-review/&amp;xcust=2-1-1679616-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">other reviews</a>. It&rsquo;s possible I misconfigured a setting. Otherwise, this is a display designed for dimly lit rooms. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="BenQ PD3220U color gamut" class="wp-image-1681378" height="859" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/BenQ-default-color.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The  PD3220U&rsquo;s color gamut at the default Display-P3 setting, without adjustment.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>I didn&rsquo;t extensively test the Color Profile Switch or BenQ&rsquo;s Display Pilot software, both of which are designed to load preconfigured color profiles onto your laptop for color matching and configuration purposes. The HotKey Puck reminds me of the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/410835/the-surface-dial-is-a-radical-puck-that-controls-microsofts-new-surface-studio-pc.html">Surface Dial</a>, just wired. The PD3220U also ships with KVM functionality built in, allowing you to easily switch between a home and work PC.</p>



<h2 id="benq-pd3220u-final-thoughts">BenQ PD3220U: Final thoughts</h2>



<p>There&rsquo;s really only one other thing I don&rsquo;t like about the BenQ PD3220U, and that&rsquo;s not BenQ&rsquo;s fault. Thunderbolt 3 hardware can sometimes suffer from a bug where the Thunderbolt connection doesn&rsquo;t immediately re-establish itself after a laptop wakes from hibernation, and prematurely removing the Thunderbolt cable can lock up the laptop. I also encountered a glitch where my cabled USB mouse (plugged into the display) stopped working. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Thunderbolt 3 cable from a laptop" class="wp-image-1683153" height="923" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/BemQ-Thunderbolt-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>One Thunderbolt cable from your laptop to the display does it all.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>A system lockup can be a major annoyance; but my other testing has shown me that this glitch occasionally occurs with Thunderbolt 3 docks and at least one of my test laptops. (The newer, improved <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/399348/intel-unveils-the-thunderbolt-4-spec-which-amd-believes-it-can-use.html">Thunderbolt 4 specification</a> and hardware can solve this problem, though the PD3220U doesn&rsquo;t use it.) Auto-saving one&rsquo;s work and a speedy SSD can make a reboot in this event less of a hassle. </p>



<p>Ignore, for now, the PD320U&rsquo;s price, at over $1,000. The display is still being marketed at professionals. Just remember, as you read reviews of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html">the best monitors</a>, that the addition of Thunderbolt capabilities isn&rsquo;t just an item that the manufacturer checked off in the specs. Thunderbolt capabilities in a display are a really big deal, and will become increasingly valuable going forward.</p>

<p>After months of waiting, the first PCIe 5.0 SSDs have finally arrived bringing blazing speeds&ndash;but is it worth making the switch? After testing <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/gigabyte-2tb-aorus-gen5-10000/p/N82E16820009042&amp;xcust=2-1-1676119-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Gigabyte&rsquo;s Aorus 10000 PCIe 5.0 SSD</a>, one of the first-ever PCIe 5.0 drives, against a stack of PCIe Gen 3.0 and 4.0 SSDs and even an ultra-expensive (and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/393961/intel-quietly-kills-its-face-melting-optane-desktop-ssds.html">now-defunct</a>) Intel Optane drive, I can say the short answer is: it depends.</p>



<p>Here are five reasons to consider switching to a PCIe 5.0 SSD&mdash;and five reasons why you might want to wait.</p>

<ul><li><strong>It&rsquo;s wickedly fast</strong>. Gigabyte&rsquo;s beast delivers blazing-fast sequential read and write speeds. PCIe 5.0 SSDs essentially double the theoretical bandwidth of PCIe 4.0 drives, which have largely topped out at about 7,000MBps read and 5,000MBps writes. We tested the Aorus 10000 hitting a hefty 10,000MBps read and a huge 10,000MBps write speeds across multiple benchmarks.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Video editors rejoice!</strong> Video editors looking to lay down high-resolution exports at high bitrates will benefit greatly from the increase in both read and write speeds. Using AJA System Test to measure writing a 16GB 4K UHD file using an AVID DNxHR 12-bit 4:2:2 CODEC, for example, saw the Aorus 10000 PCIe Gen 5 SSD skipping along at 2,746 fps versus the 1,662 FPS of the fastest PCIe 4.0 SSD that we tested.&nbsp;Obviously your workflow would need this kind of write speed, but if it does, older PCIe 4.0 drives can sit down.</li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>Latency is improved too</strong>. Latency (or responsiveness) also generally gets a nice 20 percent or more improvement over other drives using real-world tests in UL&rsquo;s PCMark 10 and 3DMark benchmark. That means generally snappier performance on the drive access tasks most people do every day.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Temps aren&rsquo;t as scary as we anticipated</strong>. Temperatures don&rsquo;t seem out of control as initially expected. Pictures of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1677185/galax-pcie-5-0-ssd-hits-retail-shelves-with-massive-heatsink-in-tow.html">exotic and huge coolers mounted on PCIe Gen 5 SSDs</a> had us scared these bleeding-edge drives were going to have a heat issue. While they do indeed get warm, our experience with the first-gen Aorus 10000 shows it can be kept reasonably cool using the motherboard&rsquo;s intended PCIe Gen 5.0 cooler. We still recommend <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394965/how-to-set-up-your-pcs-fans-for-maximum-system-cooling.html">plenty of good airflow</a> but most loads being put on the drive hint most motherboard vendors have already anticipated the higher temps of the drive in their board designs.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>You don&rsquo;t want to miss a thing</strong>. If you bought a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1520957/best-gaming-motherboards-picks-for-intel-and-amd.html">motherboard</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/401980/best-cpus-for-gaming.html">CPU</a> covered in stickers proclaiming &ldquo;Ready for PCIe 5.0 SSDs!&rdquo; to only mournfully wait months and months for just to fill that gaping hole in your motherboard, your time has finally come.</li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>You ain&rsquo;t got no Gen 5 slot. </strong>PCIe 5.0 brings an incredible performance benefit over PCIe 4.0 in pure bandwidth but to run it, you need the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/401980/best-cpus-for-gaming.html">latest CPUs</a> and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1520957/best-gaming-motherboards-picks-for-intel-and-amd.html">latest motherboards</a>. If your motherboard features PCIe 4.0 only, is it worth upgrading a CPU and motherboard for PCIe 5.0 SSDs? The harsh answer is no, not today&mdash;at least for most people. (Video editors and select others may disagree.)</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Is it <em>really </em>faster? </strong>&ldquo;Faster&rdquo; and drive storage is a really difficult area to quantify and measure sometimes. Sure, Gigabyte&rsquo;s PCIe 5.0 SSD offers legit double the sequential write speed of a Gen 4.0 drive and double-digit improvements in latency. In reality, the average person is likely to have a hard time actually feeling the difference between a good Gen 4 drive and a good Gen 5 drive most of the time outside of copying, say an entire folder of large video files or game files. The question for you is whether that scenario is worth the extra money or not.</li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>They&rsquo;re expensive. </strong>Buying a bleeding edge SSD means you will bleed. The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/gigabyte-2tb-aorus-gen5-10000/p/N82E16820009042&amp;xcust=2-1-1676119-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Gigabyte Aorus 1000</a> we looked at, for example, weighs in at $400 for a 2TB TLC NAND drive with its optional cooler. With SSD prices cratering, you can pick up a high performance 2TB TLC PCIe Gen 4.0 SSD for $160 and we recently pocketed a 2TB TLC PCIe Gen 3.0 drive for $120. While we love the speed of the PCIe Gen 5.0 SSDs, a Gen 4.0 drive that&rsquo;s double the capacity for about the same amount of cash would probably push us to the larger drive.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>The heat (and heatsinks) might still scare you off. </strong>We actually think the thermals of the drive under most normal workloads will be fine when using a motherboard&rsquo;s primary PCIe 5.0. The best cooling, however, will likely come with the SSD&rsquo;s optional or included cooler rather than the cruder chunk of aluminum that came with your motherboard. But while those likely perform better, they may not match the look of the your motherboard. That may sound petty, if you&rsquo;ve paid $800 for a motherboard, you probably want it to look like perfection, which you aren&rsquo;t going to get from the mostly fugly Gen 5.0 coolers.</li></ul>

<p>When buying a PC, you can spend a lot of time zeroing in on the right specs for your situation. But the attentiveness often ends there. After the decision&rsquo;s made, we slot the machine into a spot on our desks (or nearby), and then go about business as usual.</p>



<p>But your desk setup can have a huge impact on your quality of life day to day and upgrading it doesn&rsquo;t have to cost a lot. (Though it can if you&rsquo;re so inclined). Such was the thought of a Reddit user who asked <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/&amp;xcust=2-1-1680265-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">r/buildapc</a> what <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/114lidf/lets_talk_name_your_favorite_accessories_that/&amp;xcust=2-1-1680265-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">their favorite desk accessories</a> were.</p>



<p>I read through the list, hoping to glean a few ideas for my own setup, and I was not disappointed. (Thanks, y&rsquo;all!) And, after parsing through most of the 1K+ comments on the post, I thought I&rsquo;d save you some time and share my findings, with a little of my own commentary mixed in.<strong> </strong>While there&rsquo;s definitely overlap in what you&rsquo;ll hear from other corners of the internet, some tips were new to me (and possibly will be to you, too)&mdash;and they&rsquo;ll soon make their way onto my own desks at home.</p>

<p>A large desk pad can offer smooth, uninterrupted space for wide mouse movements, protection for your desk, and traction for keyboards and mouse pads that might otherwise shift.

<p>File another one as revelatory (for me). For years, I&rsquo;ve used 3M Command picture strips to attach things that I later wanted to remove cleanly. But this tip about reusable mounting tape offers up an alternative that&rsquo;s cheaper and more unobtrusive. Reviews suggest it&rsquo;s not great for delicate surfaces (e.g., painted walls), but the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/114lidf/comment/j8xmn74/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3&amp;xcust=2-1-1680265-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Redditor</a> who mentioned it uses it for sticking down lightweight accessories like USB hubs, which works for me.</p>

<p>As nice as headphones (or a fancy headset) can be, wearing them for long stretches can be uncomfortable. Ear sweat, pressure pain, and general overheating are common. Offloading the audio to a set of external speakers is nice when you don&rsquo;t need precise audio accuracy.

<p>Whether inexpensive or premium, rolling chairs often come with casters that can scratch hardwood floors or don&rsquo;t move well. Swapping them out for a smoother, higher quality set doesn&rsquo;t cost much and can help you roll along your floor effortlessly. (Sometimes too effortlessly when you discover that your floor is not as level as you thought&hellip;but they&rsquo;re still very nice).</p>

<p>Even if you never livestream, having a macropad&mdash;which Elgato popularized with its <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407162/elgato-stream-deck-review.html">Stream Deck</a>&mdash;can save you a lot of time when switching between apps or adjusting controls.

<p>In a similar vein, you can get much deeper control over your PC&rsquo;s audio with a volume controller, which lets you get map specific apps to different controls. No fumbling around in Windows&rsquo; Volume Mixer when your friends shout at you in Discord. You can dial them down immediately. While you can DIY your own version, more than one Redditor sang the praises of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.getpcpanel.com/shop&amp;xcust=2-1-1680265-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">PCPanel</a> as a ready-made option.</p>

<p>Ubiquiti&rsquo;s gear may be priced the same as other expensive routers, but both its consumer-friendly AmpliFi and prosumer Unifi lines give you deep control over your home network. Frankly, tech enthusiasts spending $350 to $450 (or more) on a mesh system can&rsquo;t do better. I myself upgraded to a Unifi setup and to this day, four years later, I still smile when I see all the settings and stats in the dashboard. Reddit prefers AmpliFi (the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://amplifi.com/alien&amp;xcust=2-1-1680265-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Alien</a> in particular), because you can see all of your network stats at a glance&mdash;you&rsquo;ll know instantly if your gaming connection issues are yours or your buddy&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>If you rent, you may not always have the luxury of running an Ethernet port to your PC. Building a system with Wi-Fi support can ensure that no matter where you end up with a desktop rig, it can connect immediately to the internet. Also, since Wi-Fi modules usually include Bluetooth support, you get the convenience of built-in compatibility with Bluetooth devices, too.</p>



<p>When building a mini-ITX system, you&rsquo;re best off with a motherboard with Wi-Fi, but if you&rsquo;ve got an micro-ATX or full ATX mobo, you can sometimes save money (and keep your mobo options open) by instead <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/s?k=wi+fi+pcie+card&amp;xcust=2-1-1680265-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">installing a Wi-Fi PCIe card</a> into one of your spare slots.</p>

<p>A USB microphone doesn&rsquo;t just upgrade your sound quality&mdash;though you&rsquo;ll definitely hear a big difference as compared to a headset. It frees you to pick a lighter pair of headphones, for starters. It also opens a wider world of headphones (that is, over-ear cans lacking a microphone), which lets you pick one that best suits your audio tastes.

<p>This one is revolutionizing my home setup. During the pandemic, I purchased a couple of cheap Ikea tabletops for ad-hoc WFH photography and video, and they&rsquo;re not sturdy. They can&rsquo;t handle clamp-mounted arms for a monitor or even a dedicated USB microphone on them&hellip;or so I thought until Reddit rocked my world.</p>



<p>For under $20, you can add <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/s?k=desk+reinforcement+plate&amp;xcust=2-1-1680265-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">metal reinforcement plates</a> to your desk. You slide these over the spots where you want to attach a clamped item, particularly a heavy one like a monitor. It adds rigidity and spreads out the pressure over a wider area, reducing the likelihood of denting your Ikea Linnmon table. Or watching it crumble.</p>

<p>The more desk space you can have, the less cluttered it&rsquo;ll feel. (Assuming you don&rsquo;t add more stuff.) Even if a longer table doesn&rsquo;t work, a <em>deeper </em>table can still make a difference. I recently discovered this myself after temporarily setting up on a folding table with a 30-inch depth. My usual table is just six inches shallower, but it couldn&rsquo;t handle monitor placement as well. Also, I suddenly had a lot more room for snack plates.</p>



<h3 id="better-table-legs">Better table legs</h3>

<p>Maybe your ready-made desk is wobblier on its feet than you&rsquo;d like. Or your DIY project&rsquo;s tabletop is too heavy for its legs. Provided your desktop is thick enough&mdash;usually 1 inch minimum&mdash;you can swap in workbench legs for a far more durable, resilient desk. (In the Reddit thread, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://benchdepot.com/parts/roosevelt-series-frame-with-legs.html&amp;xcust=2-1-1680265-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">these were recommended</a> in particular).

<p>Monitor arms create more room on your desk&mdash;plus they can help with ergonomics, too.

<p>Pro tip: Screen carefully for sturdy arms, especially if you&rsquo;re shopping on Amazon.

<p>Having a small side table next to your desk&mdash;be it an TV tray, end table, rolling drawer unit, or a random box (ahem) can help keep items at hand while reducing clutter. I like the box for my air purifier just fine, but there are definitely more refined options out there.</p>

<p>As weird as they look, ergonomic mice and keyboards can make a world of difference in comfort. I&rsquo;ve long been on board this train out of necessity&mdash;a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Goldtouch-GTP-0044W-Bluetooth-Wireless-Keyboard/dp/B00DT88OXK/&amp;xcust=2-1-1680265-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Goldtouch keyboard</a> and a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/Contour-Design-RollerMouse-Wired-RM-PRO3/dp/B01MTEH6WZ/&amp;xcust=2-1-1680265-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Contour Rollermouse</a> are my daily drivers.</p>



<p>You can extend that philosophy to gaming as well. PC gaming keypads can be worth the investment, and they range from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.razer.com/gaming-keypads/razer-tartarus-pro/RZ07-03110100-R3U1&amp;xcust=2-1-1680265-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">the more conventional</a> to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.azeron.eu/&amp;xcust=2-1-1680265-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">the downright wild</a>.

<p>Ok, this one&rsquo;s not from Reddit (but technically I&rsquo;m a Redditor myself, so maybe this still counts). However, if we&rsquo;re talking ergonomics at a desk, a keyboard tray can do wonders for proper alignment. You don&rsquo;t need to drill holes in your desk, either&mdash;as I just discovered myself, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1671343/this-desk-add-on-fixed-my-shoulder-pain-it-might-help-yours-too.html">fantastic no-drill keyboard trays now exist</a>.</p>

<p>Eye strain is as problematic as any shoulder, elbow, or wrist pain. Adding lighting to your desk can help with overhead glare as well as keeping your area adequately lit when you&rsquo;ve turned down most of your other lamps.
