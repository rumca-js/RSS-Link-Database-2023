<p>Dante Reyes has been plotting his revenge against Dom Toretto for over a decade, and the time is nearly here for him to execute it. The latest trailer for Fast X is here with just a month until the movie hits theaters.</p><div>          </div><p>It has everything you want: standoffs, fist fights, driving down the side of a dam, and bombs that make Fast X look like a Rocket League ad. In other words, there's a lot going on here. Dante rolls out a bomb in Vatican City and relishes the explosion, and then he corners Dom over a dam between two semi trucks, sending him racing down the sloped wall.</p><p>Not only are allies like Letty, Han and Roman back, but ex-villains Shaw and Jakob Toretto are on the side of family this time. There's a quick shot of newcomer Brie Larson cracking skulls and buying drinks. Meanwhile, Charlize Theron's Cipher has seemingly teamed up with Dante, and she's throwing fists against Letty.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fast-x-trailer-signals-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-fast-saga/1100-6513414/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Daedalic Entertainment, the developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum/">The Lord of the Rings: Gollum</a>, has explained why you'll need to pay additional money for the characters to speak Elvish (Sindarin) throughout the game.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who are unaware, Elvish is the native language spoken by elves in The Lord of the Rings franchise. It was first introduced in the books, then brought to life in the films.

They also explained that the DLC adds additional lines for background characters and that they "went the extra mile" to hire voice actors trained in Sindarin by experts. It's a DLC meant for "Tolkien devotees who want to immerse themselves."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lotr-gollum-dev-explains-why-elvish-language-is-locked-behind-paywall/1100-6513411/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Hereditary and Midsommar director Ari Aster's new movie, Beau Is Afraid, arrives this month, and one of the film's cast members doesn't know a whole lot about it.</p><p>Richard Kind (Scrubs, Curb Your Enthusiasm) plays a lawyer, Dr. Cohen, but Kind was hired very late for the project after someone else dropped out. He had a meeting on Friday afternoon, agreed to the role the same day, and began practicing his lines right away. By the following Monday--just three days later--Kind was on set at 7 AM to film his part. Given the compressed timeline, Kind didn't have a chance to read the script, and thus doesn't know much about the movie beyond his part in it.</p><p>"Because I only had two days to memorize it, I didn't have the luxury of reading the script," Kind told <a href="https://ew.com/movies/beau-is-afraid-richard-kind-has-no-idea-ari-aster-joaquin-phoenix/">Entertainment Weekly</a>.

<p>Taking the world and characters of the original Minecraft, a sandbox block builder, and putting them into a real-time strategy game with action elements is--while certainly a cool-sounding idea--an experimental move. Sadly, it's one that doesn't quite pay off in Minecraft Legends as the simple action elements actively detract from the more tantalizing possibilities present on the strategy side. However, it has good ideas outside the story-driven campaign that keep the game from descending into an absolute slog of an experience.</p><p dir="ltr">In the story campaign, you play as a denizen of the original Minecraft, who is plucked from your time and transported back to an older version of the Overworld that has long since passed into legend. This Overworld is overseen by Foresight, Action, and Knowledge--three deities who each add a dash of charm to an otherwise straightforward story of good versus evil. The simple villagers and animals are under attack by the Piglins, who are constructing portals across the land and building machines that make everything more like the Nether. In a final act of resistance, Foresight, Action, and Knowledge call on you and your building smarts to construct defenses, Golem soldiers, and war machines to slaughter the invading forces.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a fantastic concept that's made even better when the game dips into the more absurd elements--you can build giant redstone-powered cannons to lay waste to entire battalions of enemy Piglins one explosive shell at a time, for example, or construct ludicrously giant wooden bridges to safely transport troops over whole stretches of mountainous terrain. And having the chance to forge alliances with normally antagonistic Minecraft creatures, like the surprisingly honorable Skeletons and all-too-eager-to-die-for-the-cause Creepers, is also enjoyably silly.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/minecraft-legends-review-tides-of-war/1900-6418057/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Following the launch of Season 3 on April 12, a small update has arrived to make several improvements to both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii/">Modern Warfare 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20/">Warzone 2</a>, including fixes for the battle pass, crashing issues, and even a small improvement to Warzone 2's Buy Stations.</p><p dir="ltr">This new update makes small changes to Season 3's battle pass. When inspecting a sector from the map view of the pass, the selection will now automatically take players to the most valuable reward in that sector. Activision's patch notes also address an issue that previously caused some players to be kicked back to the main menu after a second attempt to enter the battle pass.</p><p dir="ltr">Last week's update for Season 3 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-season-3-battle-pass-is-now-easier-to-see-plus-more-changes-in-mw2-warzone-2-patch-notes/1100-6513283/">added more Buy Stations on the map</a> for Ashika Island Resurgence, and this week's improvement will now make it faster for controller players to buy gear from the stations.

<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4127551-themandalorianseason3finaleeastereggschapter24.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>This week on The Mandalorian, the Mandalorians try to take back Mandalore from their greatest foe, Moff Gideon; R5 gets to be a hero (again); and Grogu channels a particularly powerful scene from Rebels.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: This article contains spoilers for Chapter 24 of The Mandalorian, The Return.'</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The Season 3 finale of The Mandalorian brings us the culmination of two storylines at once, with our merry band of Mandalorians making their final push to reclaim their homeworld while also facing off against their collective chief nemesis, Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito).</p><p dir="ltr">In story terms, the finale was effectively the second of a two-part episode, and it picked up right where last week ended. The main group of Mandalorians has escaped Gideon's clutches and are hiding in the ruins of Mandalore. Gideon's army of beskar-clad stormtroopers is hot on their trail, while Imperial fighters attack the Mandalorian fleet. And the titular Mandalorian, Din Djarin, is determined to deal with Gideon once and for all, but that's not going to be easy with Gideon rocking a powered beskar suit--not to mention those scary Praetorian Guards he has hanging around.</p><p dir="ltr">While the story will give you plenty to mull over as we end another season of The Mandalorian, this episode had some rather surprising Easter eggs as well--including one scene that features nods to four different scenes in three different Star Wars movies. Let's dive in.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>1. "No, I'll take care of him myself"</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4127543-themandalorianseason3finaleeastereggschapter24gideonwilldealwithhimhimself.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Early in the episode, Moff Gideon is looking at a map of his secret base with the location of the titular Mandalorian Din Djarin marked on it. "Shall we engage?" asks one of his new beskar-clad stormtroopers as Gideon puts on his helmet. "No, I'll take care of him myself," Gideon replies, his helmet's Vader voice filter removing any question about whether he's making a reference.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a clear nod to Return of the Jedi, when Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewbacca are on the Imperial shuttle trying to sneak into Endor. During their clearance check, Darth Vader asks about them because he can sense Luke's presence. Captain Piett asks Vader if they should hold the shuttle, to which Vader replies: "No, leave them to me. I will deal with them myself." And then he walks out of the room dramatically just like Gideon does.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>2. R5's rocket jets</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4127544-themandalorianseason3finaleeastereggschapter24r5rocketboots.jpg" /><br /><h3><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Five movies into the Star Wars franchise, near the end of Attack of the Clones, we learned that R2-D2 secretly had rockets in his legs the whole time, and for whatever reason never used them. It's apparently a standard feature in this brand of astromech droid, since R5-D4 casually flies around with his rocket feet in this episode.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>3. R5's exciting data port scene</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4127545-themandalorianseason3finaleeastereggschapter24r5datapenis.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>The reason why R5 is flying around is because Din Djarin needs him to hack into the system and open some doors using his little data port phallus, pretty much echoing R2 on the Death Star in A New Hope opening the garbage compactor door for Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>4. Red laser doors</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4127546-themandalorianseason3finaleeastereggschapter24redlaserdoors.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>Amusingly, the doors that R5 needs to open are themselves a different reference to a different Star Wars movie. Din Djarin is facing a series of red energy doors in front of him, and between each set of doors is a pair of beskar troops. While the troops are an original flourish, the doors recall the end of The Phantom Menace when Darth Maul used a similar set of energy doors to hold Obi-Wan back while he fought Qui-Gon one on one.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>5.

Instead of being interrupted by stormtroopers, R5 is harassed by a little mouse droid who makes the same beeping sounds as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLqNmMH4hsg&amp;ab_channel=JenniiDigital">the mouse droid that Chewbacca roars at on the Death Star in A New Hope</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>6.

In the 1990s novel Vision of the Future, Luke Skywalker learns that Thrawn, who has been dead for a decade in that story, had a clone of himself prepared at a secret base who was intended to take power in the Empire if the real Thrawn died. Luke doesn't want to kill the clone--he's a new person and hasn't done anything bad yet--but he's eventually forced to flood the cloning chamber to escape, just as Din Djarin floods the cloning chamber to kill the Gideon clones on this episode of The Mandalorian.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>7. Grogu holds back the flames like Kanan</h2><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4127549-themandalorianseason3finaleeastereggschapter24babyyodaflames.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>At the climax of the episode, Axe Woves crashes the wrecked Mandalorian cruiser into the Imperial base, killing Gideon. Din Djarin, Grogu, and Bo-Katan are about to be incinerated as well, but Grogu uses the Force to hold back the flames and keep his friends safe.</p><p dir="ltr">We've seen this trick before, on Rebels by the Jedi Kanan Jarrus. Though it didn't work out as well for Kanan. While he was able to protect <em>his </em>friends from the flames of an exploding fuel tank, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yz0B_JTyDbM&amp;ab_channel=EverythingStarWars">he ended up dying for his efforts</a>.</p></h3></p><br />     <p><h2>8.

And, as was the case last time we had a scene here, Rebels and Clone Wars creator Dave Filoni is hanging out at the bar, easily recognizable with his signature cowboy hat that he always wears in real life. And he's actually chatting with Peter Ramsay, one of the directors on Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Ramsay directed Chapter 21 of The Mandalorian earlier this season.</p></h3></p><br />

<p>The next chapter in Legendary Picture's Monsterverse has been revealed, as a rematch between the King of Monsters and the ape wonder of the world will kick off in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. Legendary Pictures teases a new threat to the status quo of the monster hierarchy that forces Kong and Godzilla to team up, one that will reveal more of the Monsterverse and the origins of the Titans.</p><p>The titan glimpsed in the trailer appears to be from Kong's family, only with a more slender frame and a menacing stare that signals bad intentions. As Godzilla vs. Kong explained, there used to be more of Kong and Godzilla's species living in a Hollow Earth wilderness, but a war between the monsters eventually wiped almost all of them out.</p><div>          </div><p>"This latest entry in the Monsterverse franchise follows up the explosive showdown of Godzilla vs. Kong with an all-new cinematic adventure, pitting the almighty Kong and the fearsome Godzilla against a colossal undiscovered threat hidden within our world, challenging their very existence--and our own," the teaser trailer synopsis reads. "The epic new film will delve further into the histories of these Titans, their origins, and the mysteries of Skull Island and beyond, while uncovering the mythic battle that helped forge these extraordinary beings and tied them to humankind forever."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/godzilla-x-kong-the-new-empire-trailer-teases-a-colossal-threat-to-challenge-the-titans/1100-6513395/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>After Mean Girls and The Notebook, Rachel McAdams was a rising star in Hollywood in the mid-2000s. So she had a ton of opportunities that she ultimately passed up at the time, including the first Marvel Cinematic Universe movie Iron Man.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.bustle.com/entertainment/rachel-mcadams-interview-are-you-there-god-its-me-margaret">Bustle</a>, McAdams revealed that she turned down appearing in Iron Man after relocating to Canada to focus on herself and family. She also declined opportunities for roles in Casino Royale, Mission: Impossible 3, and The Devil Wears Prada. While McAdams does sometime think "I wish I'd done that," she's also gracious of who ultimately got those parts. "I step back and go, 'That was the right person for that,'" she said.</p><p dir="ltr">McAdams did ultimately become a part of the MCU in 2016 as Christine Palmer in Doctor Strange. She reprised that role last year in Doctor Stranger in the Multiverse of Madness and also provided her voice for an episode of What If…? on Disney+.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rachel-mcadams-turned-down-iron-man-role-long-before-joining-the-mcu-in-doctor-strange/1100-6513400/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>The most recent Nintendo Indie World presentation gave us another 20 minutes of updates and announcements on some exciting games from smaller publishers, all in the familiar friendly packaging similar to the popular Nintendo Direct presentations. While most of the runtime was devoted to games that are coming in the next few months or even next year, you can actually play a few of them right now.</p><p><strong>Teslagrad 2</strong> received a surprise-launch during the Direct. The physics-based puzzle-platformer has you use electromagnetic powers to find your way home after being stranded in a plane crash. And if you need to catch up with the first, the announcement came paired with word that the <strong>original Teslagrad</strong> is getting a remaster on Switch, launching today as well. They're available individually or bundled as a "Power Pack Edition."</p><p>In addition, the slapstick adventure-RPG <strong>Shadows Over Loathing</strong> received its Switch port during the Direct as well. You can purchase it on the Switch eShop now, and a physical version will be coming this fall. Finally, as shown in a quick montage near the end, <strong>Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach</strong> is out today.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/every-switch-game-surprise-releasing-today-from-nintendo-indie-world-presentation/1100-6513391/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Shulk and Rex, previous protagonists in the Xenoblade Chronicles series, will reappear in the newest DLC for Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Nintendo has announced the fourth and final wave of content for the Switch exclusive--called Future Redeemed--will arrive April 25.</p><p dir="ltr">The new story scenario actually takes place before Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Nintendo says Future Redeemed will link together the three numbered titles from the RPG franchise, hence Shulk and Rex showing up. Though keep in mind they do look different, as Shulk sports longer locks of hair and seems to be in the defender class. The DLC also features a new Unity Combo battle mechanic that has two characters teaming up to dish out an attack.</p><p dir="ltr">On top of the Wave 4 DLC, Nintendo also revealed some Amiibo news for the RPG series. For starters, the Pyra and Mythra two-pack will come out July 21. Scanning the figurines for Xenoblade Chronicles 3 will unlock sword skins for Noah, though it's noted these will be attainable inside the game in the future too.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xenoblade-chronicles-3-wave-4-dlc-release-date-announced-along-with-two-new-amiibo/1100-6513385/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Lego sets are some of the best collectibles that you can get your hands on today, as they're satisfying to build and they look great when they're completed. One such example is <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Q46YHKC?tag=gamespot-promos-20">this Star Wars diorama set</a></strong>, which translates the Dagobah hut of Jedi master Yoda into a blocky replica that is full of charm and color.

In addition to Yoda's hut, you can build the wing of the X-Wing that temporarily met a swampy fate in Empire Strikes Back, various trees, and you can complete the look by creating a marsh out of transparent blocks.</p><p>Yoda is joined by minifigs of Luke Skywalker and R2-D2, giving you all the pieces you need to recreate the Jedi apprentice's training. What makes this set stand out is that it's designed to be displayed, and it even includes a motivational plaque that contains Yoda's iconic phrase. "Do. Or do not. There is no try", as Yoda said all those years ago.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-awesome-lego-star-wars-diorama-just-received-a-big-discount/1100-6513384/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

## Insidious: The Red Door Trailer Finds The Lambert Family 10 Years Later

<p dir="ltr">The first trailer for Insidious: The Red Door is here, bringing another batch of horrors to the Lambert family's lives 10 years on. This time, though, it's being billed as the final chapter in this horrifying tale.</p><p dir="ltr">Insidious: The Red Door once again follows the Lambert family, all 10 years older, and none of them doing so well mental health wise. This first trailer shows that the whole cast is back, including Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Andrew Astor, and Ty Simpkins who plays the now college-aged Dalton. Sinclair Daniel and Hiam Abbass are also joining the cast. Judging from the first trailer, everyone's memories regarding the horrors that took place all those years ago aren't quite intact, particularly Dalton's, who remembers being in a coma as a child, but doesn't remember being sick in any way.</p><div>          </div><p dir="ltr">The film looks like it will focus on Dalton and Wilson's character Josh and their relationship, as Dalton heads off to college (one that looks like a smaller X-Mansion). The father and son pair will have to head "deeper into The Further than ever before, facing their family’s dark past and a host of new and more horrifying terrors that lurk behind the red door."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/insidious-the-red-door-trailer-finds-the-lambert-family-10-years-later/1100-6513382/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Actress Elizabeth Olsen has said she hopes to return to play Scarlet Witch once again in a future Marvel project, but as of yet, that's all it is--a hope. Appearing on <a href="https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/1648685316918714368">The Today Show</a>, Olsen said she's hesitant to even talk about this because she said her words have a way of getting twisted.</p><p>To set the record straight, Olsen said, "Yes, I hope so. But I have no idea. When I say that, it's not because I have a loaded answer. It's because I say yes, I hope so, and I mean it at face value."</p><p>Asked directly if Olsen has started filming any new Scarlet Witch content, Olsen replied, "Absolutely not."

<p>Multiple award-winning actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus was added to the pantheon of the MCU as Countess Valentina Allegra de Fontaine two years ago. She first appeared in Disney+'s Falcon and Winter Solider series--though originally supposed to come aboard in the much-delayed Black Widow solo feature. She was recently seen in Black Panther 2 and according to the actress, will be around for some time going forward.</p><p>Talking to Conan O'Brien on his podcast, the two comedy legends discussed their career trajectories when they were coming up compared to now, where there isn't really a linear path to fame going from TV to movies. Louis-Dreyfus talked about working on Seinfeld and doing the staple 22-episode seasons back then, along with having her two kids, so movies weren't really an option. Now, though she's made more movies than ever, including more appearances as Countess Val.</p><div>          </div><p>"I'm really doing these to impress my kids," Louis-Dreyfuss said.

<p>Microsoft is in the process of attempting to acquire Activision Blizzard in one of the biggest acquisitions in history. At $68.7 billion, it's not just the biggest video game acquisition; it's one of the largest of any kind across all business sectors. As such, the deal is facing regulatory scrutiny, including a lawsuit from the United States government's Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>FTC chair Lina Khan was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OQ5T9D9jbE">questioned by the Committee on Energy and Commerce this week</a>, where she faced a question about Microsoft's proposed buyout of the Call of Duty company. Khan was not able to speak directly about the deal because it's in the midst of administrative proceedings, she said. As such, she said she would let the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/2210077-microsoftactivision-blizzard-matter">FTC's official complaint</a> speak for itself. That being said, Khan was able to share some high-level thoughts on what the FTC's goal is.</p><p>Representative Diana Harshbarger, a Republican from Tennessee who <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/57">signed a resolution to impeach President Joe Biden</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/07/us/elections/electoral-college-biden-objectors.html">voted to overturn election results from Donald Trump's second presidency bid</a>, asked Khan if it's true that competition law is not supposed to protect an industry's dominant player. Khan agreed. Harshbarger then asked why--in her belief--the FTC is taking action to protect Sony, which is one of the loudest opponents of Microsoft's bid to buy Activision Blizzard.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ftc-boss-reacts-to-politicians-questions-about-microsoft-deal-to-buy-activision-blizzard/1100-6513380/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

Aside from that though, it's also added in a range of new accessibility features, notably a thalassophobia mode (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-what-horizon-forbidden-wests-new-thalassophobia-option-looks-like">Eurogamer</a>). For those who might not know, thalassophobia is the fear of deep bodies of water like the ocean or a large lake.</p><p dir="ltr">This mode does a couple of things that should help anyone that does suffer from thalassophobia. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/horizon/comments/12qm388/horizon_forbidden_west_burning_shores_faq/">According to Guerrilla</a>, "This feature aims to ease thalassophobia symptoms by improving underwater ambient visibility," which in practice translates to water looking a bit less murky, with objects in the distance looking a bit sharper.

<p>Circana, the company formerly known as NPD, has released its monthly video game sales report for the United States. There are a number of key takeaways, including Resident Evil 4 becoming the best-selling game of March 2023, Hogwarts Legacy remaining the No. 1 best-selling game of 2023 so far, and the PlayStation 5 surpassing the PlayStation 4 in a key sales metric.</p><p>PS5 sales after 29 months on the market have have now surpassed those of the PS4 over the same period of time. That's a notable accomplishment in part because the PS5 was pinched by supply issues until recently.</p><p>Spending on games in March 2023 dropped by 7% year-over-year to $3.8 billion. It was always going to be a tough comparison, though, as Circana noted that February 2022 benefitted from the launch of several key titles and strong second-month sales of Elden Ring.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-passes-key-ps4-sales-milestone-in-us-hogwarts-legacy-still-no-1-for-2023/1100-6513372/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>
