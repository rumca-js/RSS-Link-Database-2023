Upon reading this news, Megyn Kelly went bananas. As did *waves hands around* all of us.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">You tried that.

Dylan doesn't want companies to want to partner with them just to \u201ccheck a box\u201d because she's trans. He wants them to want her for them.</p><blockquote>A lot of brands will ask, \u2018Could you relate a little bit of your struggle growing up into this?\u2019 Like, no! If you want me, you want me because I\u2019m Dylan, not because I\u2019m trans.</blockquote><p>Dude, the only reason <strong><em>any company</em></strong> wants you is because you're trans. That, and I'm sure some of our right-wing outrage helps. The more we say \"Hey, this is a bit much,\" the more the left triples down.</p><p>We saw it with drag queens. Minors would <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mashable-ten-year-old-drag-queen\" target=\"_self\">dress up like women and entertain adults in bars</a>. Conservatives said, \"Hey, this seems inappropriate.\" The left doubled down with \"<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/mashable-ten-year-old-drag-queen\" target=\"_self\">Drag Queen Story Time</a>.\" Conservatives said, \"Guys, let's leave children alone because this is wrong.\" Now the left acts like the ONLY way to teach someone about tolerance is with a guy dressed like a girl and shaking their ass in a kid's face.</p><p>Dylan makes HER money (<a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/dylan-mulvaney-illegal-media-coverage\" target=\"_blank\">I don't want to get arrested</a>) partially because if companies don't sign a trans spokestrans for their brand it would mean those companies are literally insurrectionists in bed with MAGA literally. But most of it is because trans ranks #1 on the left's pound-for-pound most marginalized rankings and Dylan found a way to monetize it.</p><p>><p><p><p><p><p><\n<p>\n<em>Brodigan is Grand Poobah of this here website and when he isn't writing words about things enjoys day drinking, pro-wrestling, and country music.
