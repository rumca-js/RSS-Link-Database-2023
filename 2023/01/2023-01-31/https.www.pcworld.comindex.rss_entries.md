## Corsair’s funky new power supply moves the connectors to the side

<p>On the whole, power supplies haven&rsquo;t changed much for DIY builders. The back gets mounted to a computer case, while the power supply cables link to the front. If you end up working in a chassis with little clearance for cables, it can transform cable management into a puzzle.</p>



<p>Not so with Corsair&rsquo;s new line of RMx Shift ATX 3.0 modular power supplies, which make the radical change of moving the power supply connections to the <em>side</em> of the PSU. Or at least&mdash;the design reduces the issue, depending on your computer case. Narrow cases created with traditional power supplies in mind may not have enough side clearance; you&rsquo;ll need at least 30mm of space.</p>



<p>But if your computer case is compatible, you can take the full benefit of having a side panel of connectors. For starters, you won&rsquo;t need to make hard angles when routing your cables from the PSU to the motherboard or other components. (Good-bye and good riddance to wrestling bouts with a chunky 24-pin power cable.) That should allow for cleaner, more elegant lines.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Corsair RMx SHIFT power supply inside computer case" class="wp-image-1499096" height="674" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/CorsairRMxShift3-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Corsair</p></div>



<p>The bigger advantage is the ease in connecting cables to the power supply&mdash;you can add or remove them without having to unmount the PSU. With a modular power supply, that&rsquo;s a huge time saver. Because you insert the cables yourself, user error is always an ever-present possibility. Forgetting to add a cable, not seating a cable fully, needing to remove one that you didn&rsquo;t actually need: These are all common mistakes made while building, and often discovered after you&rsquo;ve screwed the power supply in place.</p>



<p>Corsair is offering these fully modular RMx power supplies in wattages ranging from 750W to 1200W, with every model ATX 3.0 certified, PCIe 5.0 compliant, and backed by a 10-year warranty. You also get a PCIe 5.0 12VHPWR GPU cable in the box, making the SHIFT line compatible with GeForce RTX 40-series cards out of the box. Currently, the $160 850W, $210 1000W, and $270 1200W versions are available now on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?d=corsair+rmx+shift&amp;xcust=2-3-1499073-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Newegg</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Power-Supply-Units/RMx-SHIFT-Series-Fully-Modular-Power-Supplies/p/CP-9020251-NA&amp;xcust=2-3-1499073-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Corsair.com</a>.</p>

## Unusual collab will make Office much easier to run on Chromebooks

<p>Google is promising a closer collaboration between its ChromeOS, Chromebooks, and Microsoft 365, an unusual commitment given that the two companies are usually fierce rivals in the productivity space.</p>



<p>Google said recently that the company will migrate users to a &ldquo;new integration later this year on ChromeOS, making it easier to install the app and open files.&rdquo;</p>



<p>For most purposes, Chrome OS functions as a primarily web-based experience. Currently, ChromeOS allows users to open Office apps as Progressive Web Apps, or PWAs, which are essentially web apps that can be stored and run locally on a PC. The new integration, as Google describes it, will connect the OS more seamlessly with both Office 365 <em>and</em> Microsoft&rsquo;s OneDrive cloud.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Users will be offered a guided setup experience that takes them through the process of installing the Microsoft 365 web app and connecting Microsoft OneDrive to their Chromebook Files app,&rdquo; Google said in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://support.google.com/chromeos-beta/thread/199243556/making-it-easier-to-access-and-edit-your-office-documents?hl=en&amp;xcust=2-3-1499000-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>. &ldquo;Files will be moved to Microsoft OneDrive when opening in the Microsoft 365 app.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The latter addition is particularly interesting, given that Google usually considers its cloud to be closely tied to its Workspace applications, as does Microsoft. By integrating OneDrive with the Files app, however, the process of moving, viewing, and otherwise managing OneDrive files will be a lot easier than trying to navigate multiple interfaces. It&rsquo;s worth noting, too, that OneDrive is now closely integrated within the File Explorer app within Windows. </p>



<p>Google said that it plans to formally launch the new experience in the coming months, though it will allow testers in its developer and beta channels to try out the program earlier. The story was <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23579300/google-microsoft-365-chromeos-integration&amp;xcust=2-3-1499000-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">reported earlier by The Verge</a>. </p>



<p>Microsoft has also been particularly sensitive to Chromebooks encroaching on low-end Windows laptops, even designing multiple versions of its Windows operating system to take them on. Windows 10X, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394562/microsoft-kills-windows-10x.html">whose interface was repurposed to create Windows 11</a>, was eventually cancelled.  Microsoft pitched <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/550658/windows-11-se-is-microsofts-latest-chromeos-killer.html">Windows 11 SE as its latest Chromebook killer</a>, though just for the education market. That&rsquo;s struggled, too. Microsoft still <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/business/surface-laptop-se/?ranMID=24542&amp;ranEAID=/jZHTpnCvx8&amp;ranSiteID=_jZHTpnCvx8-UCkdlc0xi.e39aYw9nm3LA&amp;epi=_jZHTpnCvx8-UCkdlc0xi.e39aYw9nm3LA&amp;irgwc=1&amp;OCID=AID2200057_aff_7593_1243925&amp;tduid=%28ir__hifa9omyyskfbggn1fvyprhovf2xcqblupwsavgs00%29%287593%29%281243925%29%28_jZHTpnCvx8-UCkdlc0xi.e39aYw9nm3LA%29%28%29&amp;irclickid=_hifa9omyyskfbggn1fvyprhovf2xcqblupwsavgs00&amp;xcust=2-3-1499000-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">advertises its Surface Laptop SE</a> for $249.99, though just three of the eight resellers Microsoft lists on its website appear to actually sell it: <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.govconnection.com/IPA/Shop/Product/Search?SearchType=1&amp;term=41464757%20or%2041328276%20or%2041328277&amp;xcust=2-3-1499000-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Connection</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.dstewart.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-se-edu-152537.html&amp;xcust=2-3-1499000-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Douglas Stewart</a>, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.insight.com/en_US/shop/partner/microsoft/store.html?country=US&amp;q=Surface&amp;instockOnly=true&amp;searchType=brand&amp;start=0&amp;salesOrg=2400&amp;sessionId=C8D7175321F46DEC26B48FBDFAC8ED00.appprd6-1&amp;lang=en_US&amp;rows=50&amp;brand=0007000444&amp;rangeFacet=InsightPrice_SalesOrg_2400_d%3A%3C+%24350%21%21under_350&amp;tabType=products&amp;xcust=2-3-1499000-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Insight</a>. </p>



<p>But it&rsquo;s possible that Microsoft is simply adapting the strategy it adopted in smartphones to ChromeOS. For years, Windows 10 Mobile was Microsoft&rsquo;s foray into the mobile space. When Windows 10 Mobile went under, Microsoft changed tactics; today, Microsoft has developed many mobile applications for Android phones and tablets, including Office. Having found success with that &ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t beat &rsquo;em, join &rsquo;em&rdquo; strategy, ChromeOS is apparently next on the list.</p>

<p>Before the smartphone, before the Palm Pilot, before&hellip;I dunno, actually, I&rsquo;m not that old. But at some point in the nebulous past, you didn&rsquo;t have an ounce of nerd cred if there wasn&rsquo;t some kind of advanced graphing calculator in your backpack. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://archive.org/details/calculatordrawer?tab=collection&amp;xcust=2-1-1499002-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Thanks to the Internet Archive</a> (of the Wayback Machine fame), you can now see how these classic machines operated without having to spend a fortune on eBay. </p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/count-on-old-school-fun-with-these-new-calculator-emulations/&amp;xcust=2-1-1499002-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ars Technica</a>, the Calculator Drawer is a collection of emulated calculators that can be run online from any browser. Emulating graphing calculators is nothing new &mdash; you can find any number of them for your phone. But this is surely the most complete collection as yet assembled in one place. At launch there are 14 classic models to choose from, mostly from the Texas Instruments catalog. Heavy hitters include the TI-83 Plus, the TI89, and the &ldquo;big daddy&rdquo; TI 92. </p>



<p>A few models from HP (popular with accountants and economics majors) are present as well, along with the &ldquo;Electronic Number Muncher&rdquo; from kid&rsquo;s electronics manufacturer VTech. And if you really want to nerd out, you can peruse 10 different uploaded text manuals as well. </p>

<p>The Gigabyte Aorus 17X, one of the first high-end gaming laptops with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, is now available to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/GIGABYTE-AORUS-17X-i9-13900HX-AZF-B5US665SP/dp/B0BSR8XMJ6&amp;xcust=2-1-1498536-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">pre-order on Amazon</a> ahead of the official launch on February 8th. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1445469/nvidia-unleashes-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-rtx-40-series-laptops-and-more.html">40-series</a> graphics cards are packing a tremendous amount of power, which is good news for content creators and hardcore gamers. According to Nvidia, &ldquo;this is the biggest leap in generational performance ever while running much more efficiently than before.&rdquo; If Nvidia&rsquo;s claim proves to be true, then you&rsquo;re in for something special. Let&rsquo;s dive right into the details.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Gigabyte Aorus 17X" class="wp-image-1498548" height="683" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-10-3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Gigabyte</p></div>



<p>The Aorus 17X is rocking an Intel Core i9-13900HX CPU, an Nvidia GeForce 4090 GPU, 32GB of RAM, and 2TB of SSD storage. Those specs are absolutely jaw-dropping and I mean that in the best way possible. This machine should be able to chew through most games on High or Ultra graphics, and it should be a beast for content creation as well. The spacious 17.3-inch display has a resolution of 2560&times;1440 and a refresh rate of 240Hz. Based on those numbers alone, the visuals should be damned near flawless. The bezels are super narrow, too.</p>



<p>This specific configuration is available to pre-order for a whopping <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/GIGABYTE-AORUS-17X-i9-13900HX-AZF-B5US665SP/dp/B0BSR8XMJ6&amp;xcust=2-1-1498536-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">$3,899 on Amazon</a>. It&rsquo;s wildly expensive, sure, but the power is unreal. If you&rsquo;ve been on the hunt for the ultimate gaming experience, the Aorus 17X may very well deliver on that front.</p>

It&rsquo;s a very good external 10Gbps USB SSD made better.</p>
</div>


<p>Though we&rsquo;ve already reviewed the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/626738/samsung-t7-shield-ssd-review-fast-ruggedized-10gbps-usb-storage.html">Samsung T7 Shield</a>, we couldn&rsquo;t resist revisiting it for the just-announced $429 4TB capacity. It was a great drive already&mdash;our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html">favorite external drive</a>, in fact&mdash;but now it&rsquo;s at home with massive data sets. </p>



<p>This new version of the already-excellent Samsung T7 Shield is bigger and faster than ever. What&rsquo;s not to love?</p>



<h2 id="design">Design</h2>



<p>The Samsung T7 Shield 4TB is basically an NVMe SSD nestled inside a USB 3.2 10Gbps housing. The SSD would likely hold up nicely if the enclosure offered 20Gbps transfer speeds, but Samsung stuck with the older, far more common USB 3.2 implementation. </p>



<p>The T7 Shield measures 3.5-inches long by 2.3-inches wide by 0.5-inches thick, and weighs just under four ounces. That&rsquo;s a little heavier than the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398724/samsung-portable-ssd-t7-touch-review.html">T7 Touch</a>, but wrapped in a silicone protective sleeve, that&rsquo;s to be expected. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1488044" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SamsungT7Shield_R-Perspective_Black-scaled-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>Samsung&rsquo;s 4TB T7 Shield is a fast and capacious external 10Gbps SSD.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Resistant-Photographers-MU-PE2T0S-AM/dp/B0BHZQGN26&amp;xcust=2-1-1484368-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">new 4TB version</a> will set you back the aforementioned $429, but the Samsung T7 Shield is also available in <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Resistant-Photographers-MU-PE2T0S-AM/dp/B09VLK9W3S?th=1&amp;xcust=2-1-1484368-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">1TB</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Resistant-Photographers-MU-PE2T0S-AM/dp/B09VLHR4JC&amp;xcust=2-1-1484368-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">2TB</a> capacities for $160 and $290 respectively (though those models are on sale for roughly 40 percent off at the time of writing). The drive is sold in three colors: blue or beige, in addition to the black model Samsung sent us.</p>



<p>I performed a couple of drop tests from about three feet onto hard surfaces, and with the drive being solid state and protected, there were no ill consequences. Indeed, it feels nice in the hand should you find yourself in a David versus Goliath circumstance. </p>



<p>The T7 Shield&rsquo;s USB connector is Type-C, and both USB Type-A to Type-C and Type-C to Type-C cables are included.</p>



<p>As to the IP65 rating, the 6 means the Shield can ward off most particulate matter, while the 5 means you can spray it with water, if not immerse it. A 7 would indicate that immersion up to three meters is survivable. No doubt the bare Type-C port has something to do with the lesser rating. If you want the complete run down on Ingress Protection ratings, this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/578310/ip-ratings-explained.html">article</a>&nbsp;on our sister publication TechHive will explain it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>This new version of the already-excellent Samsung T7 Shield is bigger and faster than ever. What&rsquo;s not to love?</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>While the T7 Shield lacks the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398724/samsung-portable-ssd-t7-touch-review.html">T7 Touch&rsquo;s</a> fingerprint reader, it can still be password-secured using Samsung&rsquo;s Portable SSD software (shown below). To use this feature, said software will need to be present on any computer you want to access the drive from. Honestly, it you want secure, opt for the T7 Touch, which&mdash;though a lesser performer&mdash;will save you lots of time and frustration by bypassing password entry. Alas, there&rsquo;s no 4TB capacity of the Touch yet. Bummer.</p>

<p>The sustained large file performance (over 1GBps in some cases) of the 4TB version of Samsung&rsquo;s T7 Shield was no surprise. More capacity generally means more NAND for caching and better sustained throughput&ndash;especially with large data sets such as our single 450GB file. </p>



<p>However, the 4TB capacity did glitch slightly in the CrystalDiskMark 8, 4K random write with 32 queues and a single thread test, scoring half what most other drives do. This was not reflected in real world performance and all the other numbers are an overall improvement over the 2TB version we previously tested.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1486852" height="524" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Samsung-T7-Shield-4TB-CDM8.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="1024" /><figcaption>In CrystalDiskMark 8&rsquo;s sequential write tests, the 4TB T7 Shield aced the competition.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It took a retest to see it, but the 4TB Shield proved the fastest 10Gbps SSD we&rsquo;ve tested, finishing only behind the three 20Gbps drives we&rsquo;ve tested. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1486860" height="600" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Samsung-T7-Shield-4TB-48GB-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>The 4TB T7 Shield also raced by the competition in our 48GB transfer tests.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The 4TB T7 Shield was also the fastest 10Gbps external SSD we&rsquo;ve tested writing 450GB, and somewhat surprisingly, bested two of the 20Gbps drives we&rsquo;ve tested. It placed second overall to the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/399150/wd-black-p50-game-drive-ssd-review.html">WD Black P50</a>&ndash;a 20Gbps external gaming SSD.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1486854" height="599" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Samsung-T7-Shield-4TB-450GB.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure></div>



<p>Other than the slight glitch under CrystalDiskMark 8 in the 4K writes, the 4TB T7 Shield is easily the fastest 10Gbps external SSD we&rsquo;ve tested. As said glitch didn&rsquo;t affect real world operations, we&rsquo;re assigning it little weight.</p>



<h2 id="vast-and-quite-fast">Vast and quite fast</h2>



<p>The Samsung T7 Shield is a great external SSD in any capacity, but the 4TB version was a revelation. Capable of handling the largest end-user data sets, it also features excellent performance, and a decent price per terabyte. It&rsquo;s great stuff for storing your stuff.</p>

## Cyberpunk 2077 levels up frame rates with Nvidia’s DLSS 3

<p>It&rsquo;s been a little over two years since CDProjekt Red&rsquo;s sci-fi opus landed, and the general consensus is that, yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty much fixed now. While <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was plagued with bugs and performance issues at launch, the developer has worked tirelessly to improve it. The latest update brings support for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1071293/6-geforce-rtx-40-series-4090-4080-secrets-nvidia.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS 3</a>, which can work with the latest GeForce cards to dramatically improve frame rates even with demanding effects enabled. </p>



<p>For the uninitiated, DLSS stands for Deep Learning Super Sampling. It&rsquo;s an incredibly complex technique that combines custom hardware processing with hundreds or thousands of hours of graphics analysis for each game. By combining this deep neural network processing with dedicated cores on RTX cards, it can allow games to enable intense effects like ray tracing without the huge hit to framerates that normally result. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>DLSS 3 is particularly impressive, as seen on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348123/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review-ada-lovelace.html#toc-5" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">preview builds of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> in our RTX 4090 review</a>, leveraging Nvidia&rsquo;s new &ldquo;Frame Generation&rdquo; technology that inserts a fully AI-generated frame between every GPU-generated frame to supercharge overall frame rates. With high resolution and RTX-branded ray tracing effects enabled, DLSS 3 can triple or even quadruple the frame rate versus the game running without DLSS. </p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="RTX 4090 DLSS 3 benchmarks" class="wp-image-1348238" height="1197" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dlss3-cyberpunk.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption><p>DLSS 3 made a massive difference to Cyberpunk&rsquo;s performance in our testing. (RT = ray tracing.)</p></figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Brad Chacos/IDG</p></div>



<p>Unfortunately you&rsquo;re going to need some serious hardware power in order to take advantage of it. Only RTX 40-series cards can use it &mdash; while older cards should see some improvements on DLSS version 1 or 2, they won&rsquo;t be anywhere near as dramatic. </p>

<div id="link_wrapped_content">
<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>You may have found that your <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-starts-force-upgrading-windows-11-21h2-devices/&amp;xcust=2-1-1487513-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow">Windows PC recently updated itself</a>, whether or not you wanted it to, as Microsoft recently began automatically upgrading Windows 11 PCs with its big annual update. It&rsquo;s been an optional upgrade since its September release. But that&rsquo;s okay: there are plenty of new things to check out in the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/827065/windows-11-22h2-review-subtle-improvements-but-not-where-it-should.html">huge Windows 11 2022 Update</a>, codenamed 22H2. The system has been given a bit of spit and polish pretty much everywhere &mdash; you probably noticed some of the more obvious interface changes, like new icons for changing volume. </p>



<p>Here are five of the more substantial changes you should check out first in the Windows 11 2022 Update. </p>



<h2 id="clipchamp-a-new-free-video-editor">Clipchamp: A new, free video editor</h2>



<p>Windows now has a new default video editor: Clipchamp. As a sort of spiritual successor to the likes of Windows Movie Maker, it&rsquo;s simpler and more accessible than professional video editors &mdash; the kind of thing you can use for a quick cut or fade-in if you&rsquo;re sharing a YouTube video with friends. The tool includes the usual basic timeline and editing capabilities, and it can upload directly to YouTube, TikTok, and various web storage services.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Clipchamp timeline" class="wp-image-708464" height="654" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Clipchamp-timeline-larger.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / Foundry</p></div>



<p>As of Windows 11 version 22H2, Clipchamp should be included in your operating system &mdash; just search for it in the Start Menu. If it&rsquo;s not there, you can download it for free <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;url=https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/clipchamp-video-editor/9P1J8S7CCWWT?hl=en-us&amp;gl=us&amp;xcust=2-1-1487513-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">from the Microsoft Store</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/708192/how-to-use-clipchamp-microsofts-video-editor.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Here&rsquo;s a full guide</a> on the basics for this new tool. </p>



<h2 id="tabs-in-file-explorer">Tabs in File Explorer&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Power users have been waiting for this one for a long time. Tabs are a feature that more advanced alternative file browsers have been using for decades, and Microsoft finally&mdash;<em>finally</em>&mdash;delivered a tabbed File Explorer in the Windows 11 2022 Update.&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1430331/use-the-new-tabbed-file-explorer-to-simplify-your-life.html">a full guide on how to use them</a>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Tabbed File Explorer" class="wp-image-1430359" height="826" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Tabbed-file-explorer-1.png?w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>To open a new tab in any Explorer window, just click the &ldquo;+&rdquo; button in the top most menu bar. Tabs work just like you&rsquo;re used to in any modern web browser, though you can&rsquo;t click and drag them into a new Explorer window (yet). While you&rsquo;re here, check out the new, streamlined left-hand menu, with faster access to system folders and your most used locations.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="folders-in-the-start-menu">Folders in the Start Menu&nbsp;</h2>



<p>If you like to have a lot of apps within easy reach in the Start Menu, you&rsquo;ll love the new folders feature. It works more or less just like folders do on the homescreen for Android or iOS (or perhaps more pertinently, Chrome OS). Any two or more shortcuts can be combined into a folder, and any folder can have a custom name.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 Start menu folders" class="wp-image-1487539" height="715" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/start-menu-folders.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>To get started, just click and drag one Start Menu icon onto another. When you see both of them shrink, release the mouse button and a folder will be created automatically. Click the new folder, then click the title to rename it. Any additional programs can be dragged in or out of the folder, and you can have as many folders as you like.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="new-ways-to-use-the-snap-bar">New ways to use the Snap Bar&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The Snap Bar is one of the most useful multitasking tools in newer versions of Windows. You might have seen it if you frequently drag windows around by their title bar: it&rsquo;s that thing that lets you move them to halves, thirds, or quadrants of your screen easily. But there are <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/830006/my-favorite-feature-in-windows-11-22h2-is.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">new ways to access it</a>.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Windows 11 snap bar" class="wp-image-1487547" height="488" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/windows-11-snap-bar.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" width="758" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>Hover your mouse cursor (don&rsquo;t click!) on the maximize window button, in between the close (X) and minimize (_) buttons in the upper-right corner. You&rsquo;ll see the six most common layout options. Click on any of the sub-grids in this pop-up to send the window to that location. You can also activate this view by typing Win + Z, then a number, then a number again to &ldquo;drill down&rdquo; into the options.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="revamped-notepad">Revamped NotePad</h2>



<p>NotePad is one of the oldest, simplest tools in all of Windows, but this basic text editor is a little more capable than you might remember. In the most basic version, it now follows the dark or light color scheme in your personalization settings.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Windows 11 notepad dark and light" class="wp-image-1487564" height="677" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/notepad-dark-and-light.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Crider/IDG</p></div>



<p>Microsoft might have even more in store for the humble NotePad. As you read this, testing versions of Windows 11 are being <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1478585/tabbed-notepad-joins-improved-settings-spotlight-in-windows-betas.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">updated with tabs in NotePad </a>in a similar addition to Windows Explorer. Whether or not this will come to the full release remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p>

## Switch faster between Chrome tabs with this keyboard shortcut
 - [https://www.pcworld.com/article/1484349/switch-faster-between-chrome-tabs-with-this-keyboard-shortcut.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1484349/switch-faster-between-chrome-tabs-with-this-keyboard-shortcut.html)

<p>Navigating between tabs in Chrome with a mouse is a slow method&mdash;no matter how many tabs you have open or how fast your reflexes are. You still have to transfer your hand to another object (whether that&rsquo;s an actual mouse or a trackpad), then move the cursor to the desired tab, and then click.</p>



<p>A keyboard shortcut is much more efficient. You can often jump straight to the tab you want in the same time it takes to put your hand on a mouse. How? With this set of keystrokes: Ctrl + a number between 1 and 8.</p>



<p>Chrome assigns a number to the first eight tabs it has open, starting from the left. If one of the tabs you need falls within that group, you only have to press Ctrl + the number of that tab to switch directly to it. <strong>Ctrl + 1</strong> gets you to the first tab, while <strong>Ctrl + 8</strong> takes you to the last tab in the set.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Multiple tabs opened in Chrome" class="wp-image-1484351" height="675" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chrometabks2.png?w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption>When collapsed, tab groups (like the one in magenta-pink shown here) do not count as a tab for this keyboard shortcut.</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">PCWorld</p></div>



<p>What if you have more than eight tabs open? <strong>Ctrl + 9</strong> will jump you to the last tab you opened&mdash;the one farthest right in the row. If you have exactly nine tabs open, this one style of keyboard shortcut is all you need for still directly hopping to the tab you want.</p>



<p>Otherwise, if you have more than nine tabs open, you&rsquo;ll want to memorize a second set of keystrokes: <strong>Ctrl + Page Up</strong> or <strong>Page down</strong>. This allows you to move to the tab to the immediate left (Page Up) or right (Page Down) of the tab you&rsquo;re in. So if you have a bunch of tabs open, you may find it faster to pop over to tab #8 or the last tab opened, and then work forward or backward, respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, once you&rsquo;ve got dozens of tabs open, these keyboard shortcuts are only good for popping over to your first and last opened tabs&mdash;I most often use them for pinned tabs. If you hoard tabs as I do, you&rsquo;re better off searching your tabs instead. (Which you can do with <strong>Ctrl + Shift + a</strong>, if you were wondering.)</p>



<p>These tab-focused shortcuts are just the tip of the iceberg for time-saving keystrokes&mdash;if you like using them, definitely check out <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1071782/10-chrome-keyboard-shortcuts-you-absolutely-should-know.html">10 Chrome keyboard shortcuts you should know</a>.
