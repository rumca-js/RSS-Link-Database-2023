It's like a free stand-up show every day. Just don't think too hard about how this is the Leader of the Free World who's also in possession of the nuclear codes, or else you'll spiral into a deep depression from which you may never return. Small details aside, it's hilarious!</p><p>Earlier today, totally mentally competent President Biden visited a dilapidated bridge in Kentucky alongside Republican Senator Mitch McConnell to highlight his infrastructure accomplishments. His administration has allotted nearly $1 trillion for roads and bridges, broadband networks, and water projects in a plan spearheaded by Transportation Secretary <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/pete-buttigieg-tax-credit\" target=\"_blank\">Pete Buttigieg</a>. </p><p>While speaking in Kentucky, Biden referenced a  \"phrase from his old neighborhood\" about patches on jeans:</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cBiden: \"I\\u2019ll paraphrase the phrase of my old neighborhood: The rest of the countries, the world is not a patch in our jeans, if we do what we wanna do, we need to do.\"\\u201d</div> \u2014 Greg Price (@Greg Price)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/greg_price11/status/1610703976206417937\">1672856728</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Such a beautiful and inspiring statement from ol' Scranton Joe.</p><p>At another point during his speech, Biden randomly began yelling about the recession \"two years ago.\"</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cJoe Biden: \"Think about why the recession got so bad two years ago.\"\\n\\nJoe Biden took office two years ago.\\u201d</div> \u2014 Julio Gonzalez - juliogonzalez.com (@Julio Gonzalez - juliogonzalez.com)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TaxReformExpert/status/1610707828158742537\">1672857646</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's unclear what recession Biden is referring to since we've been assured by his administration that there is no recession.

Rep. AOC, I would bet, agrees with Gaetz and Goasr on style.

The Catholic Catechism states that abortion is a mortal sin, or an act that \u201cdestroys charity in the heart of man by a grave violation of God's law; it turns man away from God.\" Joe Biden was denied Communion in South Carolina back in 2019 over his support for abortion. Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/nancy-pelosi-chronicle-pope\" target=\"_self\">Nancy Pelosi</a> was also denied Communion by the archbishop of San Francisco, Salvatore Cordileone. Cordileone said Pelosi was engaging in scandal by leading other Catholics astray from Church teaching and preferring her own judgment.</p><p>Pro-abortion, self-proclaimed Catholic politicians seem to be having an unfortunate effect on American Catholics. According to Pew Research, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/20/8-key-findings-about-catholics-and-abortion/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">56%</a> of Catholics believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, despite this putting them at odds with Church teaching. That stat does fall once Mass attendance is taken into account. </p><p>Back in September, Karine Jean-Pierre was unable to answer whether or not Biden supports any limits on abortion at any point in pregnancy. Last year, Pope Francis <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/pope-criticizes-bidens-abortion-views-catholic-self-identity-incoherence\" target=\"_blank\">described</a> Biden's support for abortion as \"incomprehensible\" and advised the President to check his conscience. </p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\">\n<div style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">\\u201cPeter Doocy asked Karine Jean-Pierre whether Biden supports ANY limits on abortion.\\n\\nKJP spends TWO WHOLE MINUTES filibustering, dodging, and refusing to answer the question.\\u201d</div> \u2014 Townhall.com (@Townhall.com)\n        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/townhallcom/status/1573395740520751104\">1663961751</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, Biden <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-pope-francis-told-good-catholic-amid-criticism/story?id=80769817\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">claimed</a> Pope Francis called him a \"good Catholic\" and to continue receiving Communion, and that the issue of abortion didn't come up at all during their unusually long 90-minute meeting.

It has an Elon Musk tie and everything.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble\">\n\n</p>\n<p>There is a custom suit company that made Peterson twelve suits for each of his 12 Rules for Life. When asked if he wanted a Twitter suit, Peterson responded \"well, NOW I do.\" The Elon Musk tie is getting the bulk of the attention, but for me, it's the lining made up of Twitter comments that screams \"Drip Gawd.\"</p><p>Some people are making fun. But I think the suit makes him look like a based Doctor Who.  Tell me you wouldn't love to see Peterson's adventures throughout all of space and time. </p><p>My only regret is that he didn't rock this suit BEFORE Elon took over. The meltdowns from Twitter 1.0 employees could have been turned into a renewable energy source. Some of them may have been too triggered to come out of their nap pods.</p><p>Elon Musk hasn't commented yet on Peterson's styin' and profilin'.

Anything to have an excuse to impeach Donald Trump. That was his main quest. It turns out from the Twitter Files, he had a side quest to get journalists suspended who he didn't like.

Though, unlike liberal media, I'm not using \"chaos\" as a pejorative. Chaos is good if there is a reason behind it. And as you are about to hear from Matt Gaetz and Chip Roy, there are specific and understandable reasons WHY they are blocking Kevin McCarthy from becoming Speaker.</p><p>First, a mea culpa because I <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/ron-desantis-inauguration\" target=\"_blank\">was a little too smug yesterday in \"bothsidesing\" how embarrassing everyone was</a>. I was distracted and not paying as close attention as I should have been. To be clear, Kevin McCarthy is a swamp creature who stands for nothing, and he's not entitled to deez nuts let alone to become Speaker of the House. The entitlement is what it boils down to. The Rebels want changes to the rules and to have actual debates on issues to affect change for the American people. The Only Kevins only want Kevin because it's his turn. And they're the side making things personal.</p><p>Which as <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/masks-chip-roy\" target=\"_blank\">Chip Roy</a> (who would be my pick for Speaker) says, it's strictly business.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Patriot <a href=\"https://t.co/fvsKLcodes\">pic.twitter.com/fvsKLcodes</a><br />\u2014 Wade Miller (@WadeMiller_USMC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WadeMiller_USMC/status/1610386168365056001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 3, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>This place has to change.
