<p>Has this happened to more people?<p>I just noticed this, and so this happened to a few friends of mine.<p>I am familiar with dark patterns, and read carefully and I though I had dodged all Microsoft attempts at trying to register me into their online system, but somehow they got me.</p>

## Tell HN: Best Use for old iPads (that I found)

<p>Last month I asked[0] what could be done with an old iPad; the responses led me to discover Alfred Home Security[0] and It's exactly what I was looking for. The winning feature being, you can repurpose any old iOS device as a camera.<p>I have since used the app with 2 old iPads, and an iPhone 7 Plus. Works better than I expect, really nicely done app.<p>The motion detection is spot-on. I've been mostly using this to see what our new very shy kitten is up to since we've only seen him twice in 5 weeks; basically he's impossible to find during the day and only comes out to play after we're asleep. The videos are super fun / cute, and it's nice to see he's having fun and in good health! [3]<p>Alfred Security also make a impressive, very inexpensive camera ($34 US, 1080P, night vision, 130 degree viewing angle and easy to mount). I just received 3 of the 4.<p>TLDR: last month I wanted to know what was the best use for old iPads /iOS devices, and I've since discovered Alfred Home Security[1].<p>Supported Devices[2]:<p>Android: Android 4.4 or above (For a better experience, operating systems above Android 5 are highly recommended)<p>iOS: iOS 10 or above<p>Original post:<p>[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34165418<p>[1] https://alfred.camera/<p>[2] https://alfredcamera.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039755571-What-devices-and-systems-do-AlfredCamera-support-<p>[3] https://alfred.camera/tv/9IHo74Mj5<p>* I have nothing to do, nor any affiliation with Alfred other than pay for and use their products.
* Original Post is locked; I couldn't post this information there.
* Updated with devices / link, and kitty video link (this is off an old iPad, not the Alfred Camera), and formatting.</p>

## Ask HN: Do you or someone you know give money to your parents?

<p>I've been trying to find tax / life advice about giving money to parents and I've been unable to do so. Every year or two I give my parents about $10-15k. This year I'm giving them $30k and I'm unable to find any relevant details about this.<p>Does anyone else give money to their folks? Is there any guidance on how to do this? I'm writing a check but in the past have done cash, but I find it all very inconvenient and confusing for tax purposes.<p>Thanks</p>

## Ask HN: How do you choose your usernames?

<p>Basically the title. Every time I want to sign up for websites, the hardest and most time consuming part is choosing the username. I just never got why some people add seemingly random numbers in the end. I've always wanted the username to mean something or be special in a way. There have been times when I spent almost half an hour trying to come up with a better username, esp. on websites that don't allow you to change the username in the future.<p>How do you come up with your usernames? And is it really important in this day and age?<p>See this for example: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5742175/</p>

<p>The best part of rust is not coding, it's debugging.<p>You get about 30 or something number of errors in large project. And you debug, one by one, and one by one. It goes down to 30, 29, 25, 24 .. and with a little patience you get it down to 4, 3, 2, and a error. Sometime you can even increase errors, because there is error around error, but it generally goes down just as quick.<p>Then you correct the last bug, and it then shows `Finished dev in ## seconds`. And, most probably, your code works just as you expected. No memory bugs, no side stuffs. Sure, there can be logical errors, and it can be corrected. But no hard to know errors. The error message tells you how to correct your syntax error. It's a bit opinionated, but it's good and, at the end of day, it guides you to write a decent code. And finally with `cargo fmt`, and your code looks just as compact and pretty as flawlessly it works.</p>
